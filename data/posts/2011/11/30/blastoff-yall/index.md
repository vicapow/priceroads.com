## [Blastoff Y’all](/2011/11/30/blastoff-yall/ "Permalink to Blastoff Y’all")


Welcome to PriceRoads, a whole site dedicated to clear thinking about road pricing. We’ve got a bunch of short/sweet animations, FAQ’s, links, writing, and this blog you’re reading. PriceRoads is an ongoing project, so check back like once per week. The blog will feature weekly news and commentary on road pricing worldwide.

PriceRoads is definitely pro-road pricing, but you should check it out even if you oppose road pricing. If you’re a government official trying to convince folks road pricing isn’t crazy, this is the place!
