## [The Limits of Congestion Pricing?](/2011/12/13/the-limits-of-fake-congestion-pricing/ "Permalink to The Limits of Congestion Pricing?")


At The Atlantic Cities blog, Eric Jaffe lays out a [skeptical analysis](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2011/11/limits-congestion-pricing/590/) of Transport for London’s [congestion charge](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/):

At first the benefits were enormous: in response to the rising cost of driving into the city, congestion fell by roughly 30 percent. But those gains quickly reached a plateau, and since then congestion has started to near its pre-pricing levels.

He’s paraphrasing an [upcoming paper](http://usj.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/09/10/0042098011417017.abstract) in Urban Studies from Oxford’s Moshe Givoni (one of two famous [Moshe’s](http://cee.mit.edu/ben-akiva) in transport studies!). My only bone to pick is that the implementation is flawed, so the conclusions don’t apply to congestion pricing generally.

We can all agree that, at someprice, someLondoners currently driving would stop.Unfortunately, Transport for London has not increased its charge since 2008 (£10). Pricing means matching supply to demand, and if demand has increased but the toll hasn’t changed, then TfL isn’t really “pricing” anymore than the PA Turnpike is.

To paraphrase [GK Chesterton](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#What.27s_Wrong_With_The_World_.281910.29):

Congestion pricing has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried.
