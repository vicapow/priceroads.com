There was a March Madness competition among urbanist policies over at [Atlantic Cities](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/04/urbanist-toolkit-bracket-challenge-championship-round/5190/), and congestion pricing made it all the way to the Final Four but lost out to bike lanes. Great job guys, and better luck next year. I don’t think congestion pricing would have made it out of the first round five years ago. It’s a strong program that can only get better, and we’ve got some great prospects coming up.
