Fosgerau and Small (2012). [Endogenous scheduling preferences and congestion](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~ksmall/EndogenSchedPrefs.pdf).

The authors look under the hood of the piecewise schedule delay function, which values each minute of earliness at one price and each minute of lateness at another. In a nutshell: for the morning commute, being at home before work is more enjoyable when your family is there, and you’re more productive at work when your coworkers are there. Therefore, if you get to work earlier than people typically do you’ll be giving up time when your whole family is at home in exchange for time when few people are at work…a lousy trade-off. Hence people tend to all want to be at home or work simultaneously, but the system can only switch over everyone from home to work with a queue. What’s the implication for tolling?_

A naïve Vickrey-like analyst — observingone equilibrium and assuming scheduling preferences to be exogenously given —would ﬁnd that to be in accordance with his model. But because he ignores thepositive temporal agglomeration externalities associated with being at home or atwork, this analyst will underestimate the beneﬁts of a toll that reduces queueingduring the commute and will make potentially very large errors in predicting theeffect of policies such as capacity expansion and tolling. For some parameter sets,such an analyst would apply a toll schedule and/or aim for a departure patternthat is quite far removed from the optimal one.

Translation:Thinking about how people work and play together means tolling is more beneficial than we thought. Why? Let’s I spend one hour per day waiting at an off-ramp downtown. Bam! You kill the queue with a toll. Now I spend that hour at home or work, where other people reap the advantagesof my presence. And I reap the advantages of other people’s extra time at home or work. A good deal all around.

What does this mean for winning arguments? A layman always doubts a high-income person’s value of time is truly higher, because it takes training for someone to accept willingness-to-pay as a measure of benefit, and because most people don’t think of a high wage worker as selling their labor in a competetive market place where the wage is commensurate to the value. Most people, focused on private gains, think of a high wage worker as someone who has ‘worked their way up.’ Maybe it’s easier to accept, though, that lower-level workers need their boss in the office to be productive, and it hurts them when he’s tied up in traffic.
