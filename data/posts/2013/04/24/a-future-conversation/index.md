Milo Lehe: (named for Milo’s Sweet Tea)

Hey grandpa, I just saw the 50th season of Mad Men, Mad Men: 2013\. Did you really drive your own cars around?

Lewis Lehe:

Boy did we! I was a professional race car driver actually.

Milo Lehe:

Well, there must’ve been a lot of barriers between lanes.

LL:

Nope! Sometimes you’d be going forty, and someone else’d be going forty in the opposite direction about six feet away in the middle of the night.

ML:

What if your wrist or your foot slipped a litle bit?

LL:

Sometimes you’d hit a school bus. Other times you’d just go off a bridge or a cliff or something.

ML:

Woah! Back up! You’re telling me people died right in the road?

LL:

It was like a serial killer attacked every city every day. And if someone in your high school got killed, the school had a Power Point slideshow of their class pictures, and everyone would cry, even if the guy was drunk as Christopher Hitchens on Guy Fawke’s Day and doing donuts in a VA Hospital parking lot when he went out.

ML:

Wait a minute, it was legal to drive drunk?

LL:

No! But…there were parking lots at bars. We knew what was going on. And there was this one actress named Lindsay Lohan…she was always drunk driving around so they…now I’m getting mixed up…so Giggle made her a special white Volkswagen bug that drove itself around, and that was the first driverless car. And it could talk! It was called Knight Rider. [nods off]

ML:

Mom, can we put grandpa in the back seat next time? He’s drooling on the emergency wheel.

Jemima Lehe:

Have some respect. He’s 120 years old and has ten master’s degrees.
