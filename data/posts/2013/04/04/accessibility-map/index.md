Excellent accessibility ranking by Dr. David Levinson (the T[ransportationist](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/levin031/transportationist/)) and the Nexus Research Group at University of Minnesota:

California has the #1 and #2 most accessible cities, and they provide an interesting contrast in two ways to get accessibility. Accessibility can come from density (everything is close together so it doesn’t take long to go from one place to another) or mobility (everything is far apart but there are huge highways so you can traverse long distances).

I’m excited to see academics using visual media to put across point about public policy.
