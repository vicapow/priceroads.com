[Back here](http://priceroads.com/2012/01/13/washington-metro-turns-down-money/ "Washington Metro Turns Down Money") I commented on the sad end of the peak-of-the-peak fare on the DC Metro.

Now a reader has written into WaPost’s Dr. Gridlock with a nuanced support of congestion pricing. ([link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/should-metro-charge-congestion-fares/2012/02/28/gIQA3t2SpR_story.html))

The goal should be congestion relief, not revenue. The current peak-of-peak fare was designed with revenue enhancement in mind. A true peak-of-peak system would focus much more narrowly. For example, no peak surcharge would apply for those traveling in a direction opposite the main flow of riders.

I agree that a good fare policy woulddiscriminateon the basis ofdirection. But why shouldn’t revenue be one of the twin goals of congestion pricing? The DC Metro is running an enormous deficit and will have to increase fares 5% next year.
