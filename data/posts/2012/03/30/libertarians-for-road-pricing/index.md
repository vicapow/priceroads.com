At [The Freeman](http://www.thefreemanonline.org/headline/donald-shoup-takes-san-francisco/) online, Professor Sandy Ikeba of SUNY-Purchase muses on San Francisco’s demand-priced parking meters:

As I said before, to do market pricing correctly, well, you need markets. What the San Francisco approach does is to try to mimic what it is thought a private market would do. But the standard of “at least one empty parking spot” is arbitrary – like mandating that every ice-cream cone have two and only two scoops of ice cream. The Shoup-inspired San Francisco solution is I think a step in the right direction, but only a step.

Street parking is zero-priced because those streets, and the curbs and sidewalks that abut them, are not privately owned.

I wish libertarians would give more unqualified support for governments that practice road pricing and parking pricing (road pricing for stationary cars). I think Dr. Ikeda supports San Francisco’s plan, but it’s kinda buried. He obviously supports privatization, but privatization is not on the agenda in San Francisco, nor will it be. Elsewhere he criticizes Mayor Bloomberg’s congestion pricing plan as “intervention,” which from a libertarian has undertones of opposition:

Every so often during his tenure as mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg has tried to push through congestion pricing, in which drivers would have to pay to use city streets in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. That’s a popular solution to chronic overcrowding but, like drinking coffee to try to cure a hang over, it doesn’t really get to the heart of the matter. More intervention usually doesn’t solve the problems that were themselves the result of a prior intervention.

This is a problem with libertarians: you can’t figure out how they rank policies below their favorites and above their worst-case scenarios. For example, I know libertarians abhor Keynesian fiscal stabilization, and I know that thinking libertarians like [George Selgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Selgin) want “free banking” to determine (or undertermine, as you will) macro-stabilization. But in-between it’s unclear what to do, which leads a wide berth forasininegold fetishism/Internet-Austrianism/superstitious fear of “printing money.” That’s why a libertarian like Scott Sumner, whose NGDP-level-targeting strategy would neutralize the case for fiscal policy in its entirety by making the multiplier zero, gets angry comments from libertarians. On road pricing, this ambiguity leads grassroots liberty-lovers to organize against strategies that, while not fully free market solutions, at least embrace the price system and give drivers more choice. Other times I hear about people filing lawsuits against private utility companies for installing smart meters, in the interest of liberty. To be clear, I think the libertarian intelligentsia does have these policies ordered, but there always seems to be a vagueness in their advocacy I wish they would drop, even if it pissed off your run-of-the-mill Ron Paul/conspiracy theory libertarian.

To be clear, I’m not a libertarian. I’m a registered Democrat, because social insurance is a success.
