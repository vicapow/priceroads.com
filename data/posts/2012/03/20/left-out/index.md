Matt Yglesias makes a good point ([link](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/housing/2012/03/mixed-politics-urbanism/1525/))

When progressives, for example, see a fight pitting a neighborhood activist against rich developers, their instinct is to side with the activist, even if all the developer really wants to do is erect a building that will allow a lot more people to live or work or shop in their neighborhood…

But the fact that houses and offices are built by rich businessmen shouldn’t distract people. The important issue is that American families need houses to live in. If space is scarce, then poor people won’t be able to afford homes and low-margin businesses and startups won’t stay in business.

I wonder what progressives will make of private corporations charging people to drive cars on major roads. A rich businessman is winning, but so are bus-riders and air-breathers. I’m not really excited about road privatization either, but for different reasons.

I just read The Rent is Too Damn High. It is way too short, and I wasdissatisfiedas a customer. The Great Stagnation is my reference point for ebooks.

Anyway, I think the road pricing movement and the housing deregulation movement go hand-in-hand both ideoogically and politically. They are brothers-in-arms for the unmitigated price system. And, more practically, I think it will be impossible to price entire highways as long as exurbs are the default option for lower-middle income people. Exurbs are waaaay cheaper. If we could build up cities and inner-ring suburbs more, then geographic equity would become divorcedfrom income equity. It would seem as imaginary as it actually is.
