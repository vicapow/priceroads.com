[Matt Yglesias](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/02/the_scourge_of_garbage_in_garbage_out_research_on_innovation.html) makes some good points about patenting, but also draws attention to this innovation:

As an example, my favorite place to get lunch by my office is[Chopt](http://choptsalad.com/)a small NYC/DC salad chain that’s engaged in a lot of interesting business model innovation. One thing they do is that at peak demand times when the store gets crowded and things get hectic, they employ a guy to serve as a kind of “traffic cop” who directs customers to the optimal line to order at.

This might be a good idea or might be a bad one. But if it’s working for them, it’s a real example of TFP-boosting innovation. It does, yes, involve adding a little bit of extra labor (the traffic cop) to the production function. But it’s not highly skilled labor. And the point of it isn’t a linear addition where you have one extra guy making salads. Instead the idea is that at peak demand times, employing a traffic cop lets everyone work more efficiently. The same stock of labor (cashiers, salad-makers) and capital (physical space, mezzalunas, cash registers) is producing more salads by having the customers flow more efficiently through the space. And yet this innovation is not patentable and it would be a public policy disaster to grant a patent for it.

It’d be cool to model the flow here.
