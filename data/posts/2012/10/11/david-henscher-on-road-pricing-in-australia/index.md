[Kilometre-based charging](http://theconversation.edu.au/to-reduce-congestion-imagine-the-government-charged-by-the-kilometre-10035)

My colleagues (Professors Bliemer and Mulley) and I suggest that this can be achieved by lowering vehicle registration fees together with a distance-based charging regime. Such a package can deliver financial gains to motorists with potential for revenue growth to the State Treasury of Sydney…

We see this as an essential first stage in gaining community support for road pricing reform. Proof of cost reductions associated with improvements in traffic congestion can then be used to continue the reform process…

This road pricing reform plan would require drivers to purchase an on-board unit (approximately $50 one-off cost), that will record the kilometres by time of day. The off-peak kilometres are not charged, but peak kilometres will be charged at the agreed rate.

David Henscher is a giant of the field, and it’s good to see people thinking about politically acceptable ways to price roads. My current research is about a cordon scheme whereby you can get a rebate for time spent parked.
