As Houston [opens new HOT lanes](http://app1.kuhf.org/articles/1354035819-Houston-METRO-Offers-New-Option-For-Getting-Around.html) on its I45 North, we see again the argument I noted was being used in LA [a while back](http://priceroads.com/2012/11/16/false-hope/ "False Hope?"):

“We’ve put a lot of money, with the cooperation of the federal government, into the creation of our HOV lanes. We want to make sure they’re used as much as possible, getting a good return for our investment.And what this program allows us to do is get more use out of them at times when they otherwise might not be used to capacity. At the same time, we’re giving people the opportunity to get a little faster trip.”

I suppose this is the best way to justify HOT lanes to the average person: we are filling up the HOV lanes.
