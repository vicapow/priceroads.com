Texas Feral Hog Wrecks Mark Losing Battle With Animals

Even before the fastest highway in the U.S. opened, collisions began. Feral hogs were on the move.

Police report at least four such wrecks on the 85 mile (137 kilometer) per hour stretch since traffic began flowing Oct. 24…

The newly opened 41-mile toll-road stretch, built by units of [Ferrovial SA (FER)](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FER:SM "Get Quote") and Zachry Corp. and run as a concession, costs as much as $8.21 for a passenger car to travel its length. Highway operators are putting up wildlife-crossing signs to warn drivers, said Chris Lippincott, a spokesman.

Curbing the hog threat probably will require toll-road officials and the state to work with neighboring landowners on trapping the pigs and erecting stronger fences or barricades, Higginbotham said.

I don’t know who to root for here. Pigs are my favorite animals but toll roads are my favorite roads.
