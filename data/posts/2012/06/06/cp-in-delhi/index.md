A good Wall Street Journal article about Bus Rapid Transit in Delhi.[Urban Journal: Why Everyone Should Want Delhi’s BRT](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/05/25/delhi-journal-the-big-bad-brt/tab/comments/)

Most importantly, this was good news:

Congestion Pricing is Coming to Delhi:In early 2010, under a Delhi High Court order, a Special Task Force was set up to study problems related to traffic congestion in the city. Among the subsequent proposals, congestion pricing was recommended for heavy vehicles entering Delhi and all vehicles entering certain congested parts of the city’s center and old quarter.

In December 2011, news broke that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi planned to charge car drivers 150 rupees ($2.70) and motorbike riders 50 rupees during the day (residents of congestion zones would be exempt in their area). Even though experts believe the plan would be difficult to implement in Delhi, it remains an option that may well be turned to in the future (or may manifest itself as an[increased tax on fuel in the city](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/08/delhi-congestion-charge-ease-gridlock)).

Increase in Parking Fees:The Special Task Force also recommended a re-evaluation of parking practices in Delhi.

…

And the Delhi Government is looking into it. In early May, Delhi’s Transport Department posted a[public notice](http://www.delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/c738d2804b2d39908224cf53a18bfeba/STF+PUBLIC+NOTICE.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&lmod=-568701045)inviting feedback on the proposal to increase parking fees. Existing fees range from about 10-20 rupees an hour, but the new proposal is to charge a fee of 50 rupees for the first three hours during peak times and 30 rupees for the first three off-peak hours. After this, every subsequent peak hour will cost 30 rupees, and every off-peak hour 20 rupees. The proposal also includes a monthly charge of 1,500 rupees for residents, who have been parking for free until now.

Delhi has air problems and terrible congestion, even though few of its trips are by car.
