[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/technology/amtrak-to-use-iphones-to-streamline-service.html?_r=2):

With the new system, passengers will be able to print tickets or load a special bar code on their smartphone screens for conductors to scan, and conductors will be able to keep track of passengers on board, Amtrak said.

“You don’t even need to print the document and bring it with you,” said Matt Hardison, chief of sales distribution at Amtrak, who helped plan the iPhone program. “We’ve made a number of important improvements for both our customers and Amtrak, all in one fell swoop.”

New technology cuts transaction costs. Easy transactions help organized firms to compete with self-sufficiency. That is, it lets The Market compete with Autarky. Transportation has more autarky than any industry besides housekeeping, but technology is changing all that.ZipCar allows people to pool auto capacity instead of individually buying cars. RFID, electronic banking, and plate-reading cameras allow governments to turn road capacity into a saleable commodity. JustEat makes it easy to get free delivery.

Easy transaction costs also allow small ‘firms’ to compete with large ones. Recently in Minneapolis I stayed in a dude’s room for $26/night instead of a hotel for $40, thanks to AirBnB. Craigslist let individuals kill the newspaper classifieds.

As to mass transit like AmTrak, it’s unclear how things average out. iPhone payment helps trains compete with autarky (people driving between cities alone). But a kind of iPhone payment (showing the driver your confirmation email) also helps competitor Megabus pickup people at the curb. And online booking faciliatates[yield management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_management), which enables more frequent, more customized services on a larger bus network. Eventually, iPhone payment between individuals will make it really easy to carpool.

My prediction for the future is that most rail firms, intercity and intracity, are going to die. Wireless payment only speeds up buses (what train is slowed down by people paying?). GoogleTransit is way more useful for buses than for trains (who can’t figure out where a subway goes?). Road pricing clears the way for buses to go faster. In the 20-year long run, autonomous vehicles will dispense with the unions, mandatory breaks, and minimum sizes that hinder bus service. Buses are more labor-intensive than trains but less land-intensive. Thus, every single trend is favoring buses more than trains.

To go a little sci-fi, in the future we will have ‘buses’ of varied sizes (some being merely cars) running exactly at capacity over unintuitive-but-efficient spiderweb networks with unintuitive-but-efficient schedules. In some cases, regular headways and circular routes represent efficiency bowing to memorability. But theincomprehensibilityof a system designed by operations researchers won’t matter in the future, since we’ll be guided by smart phones that tell us where to go at what time. Stops will be infrequent and will take place quickly, especially once we have specialy-equipped buses for the handicapped and elderly.

Finally, I believe that this high-accessibility system will enable a much higher labor-force participation rate. If you think of a day’s work as a production function, there is a high fixed cost to arriving and leaving work. For workers with low productivity (uneducated, low IQ, lazy, handicapped, recent immigrants or elderly), this makes it not worthwhile to even make it into the office/factory/housecleaning job. But in the future I have outlined, accessibility is so high that everyone will be able to get everywhere; and low-productivity workers will be able to trade their abundant time for money with unprecedented ease.
