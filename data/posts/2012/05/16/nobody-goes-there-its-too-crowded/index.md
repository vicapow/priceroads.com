Timothy Lee reflects on building restrictions in the Bay Area. This is close to my heart, because I’m going to get my PhD in Transportation Engineering at UC Berkeley in the fall and will be paying a lot of rent. ([link](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/05/10/why-the-bay-area-should-have-11-million-residents-today/))

Today, the Bay Area has about 7 million residents. In a free housing market, the population of the San Francisco Bay Area would have been growing rapidly over the last two decades. For example, between 1900 and 1920, the growth of the auto industry helped the population of the Detroit metro area nearly triple, from 540,000 people to 1.4 million people. If the San Francisco Bay Area had grown that fast since 1990, it would have about 16 million people today.

In the debate over liberalising cities, I notice a whole lot of commentors make a logical error.

People in the Silicon Valley are drawn to the culture of the valley. It’s a culture of living and enjoying the non-urban world around them. 365 days a year there is something to do and see here and it goes far beyond shopping and museums. Mix in another 4 million people and what makes this valley great would disappear or at least get crowded out.

The commentor is basically saying that, if more people were able to live in Silicon Valley, then people wouldn’t want to live in Silicon Valley. That reminds me of the Yogi Berra quote “Nobody goes there; it’s too crowded.” The reason that the Yogi Berra quote is funny is that it contains a fallacy. It’s wrong. What’s wrong about it is that what’s true of an individual–not wanting to go to a crowded place–is impossible to be true of society generally. It’s kind of like how, when you learn calculus, it’s mindboggling that the y*dx’s are individually negligible but somehow add up to big numbers.

This fallacy is really common. I hear all the time that, if cities had congestion pricing, then people won’t be able to get to work/businesses will move out. But if that were true, then the congestion price would be zero.

I don’t actually know very much about why cities restrict development, but I do know this is a bad argument.
