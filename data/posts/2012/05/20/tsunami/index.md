### Baruch Feigenbaum at Reason Foundation ([link](http://reason.org/blog/show/transportation-policymakers-need-to)):

Earlier this week I was at a congestion pricing workshop hosted by the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and consulting firm ICF in Providence, Rhode Island. Four of these workshops have already been held around the country and although this workshop was intended primarily to attract participants from the New England states, participants came from as far away as California, Florida and Iowa. The workshop included Planners and Engineers from Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington D.C.

This is great. The whole intellectual apparatus of transportation policy, operating at local through national levels, is dead set on piece-meal congestion pricing.

In the social sciences, nothing happens as fast or as slow as you’d think. No one predicted the Arab Spring. The economic theory of regulation still can’t explain the wave of deregulation in the 1980′s. Imagine explaining the Tea Party to someone in 2006\. I think there’s a good chance that the 10′s will be the decade of road pricing.
