Vancouver is ripe for cordon based congestion pricing, because it has few access points. It’s a sideways Manhattan, with fewer bridges:

Traffic is sort of a big deal. In 2011, [traffic problems cost Vancouver](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/08/30/bc-vancouver-livability.html) their “World’s Most Livable City” crown from The Economists Intelligence Unit:

Jon Copestake of the Economist Intelligence Unit told CBC News the ranking reflects what he calls “regional” traffic issues.

Can you really write “World’s Third Most Livable City” on your highway signs? Third Place is Second Loser. Now they’re trying to do something about it. This piece from[Joel Wood](http://www.fraserinstitute.org/about-us/who-we-are/staff/senior-research-staff.aspx)of the Fraser Institute, @ [The Vancouver Sun](http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Congestion+pricing+needed/6677021/story.html), is dripping with Canadian reasonableness:

To tackle [congestion], Metro Vancouver Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation last month hit on the one obvious solution that has worked elsewhere: a comprehensive system of bridge and road tolls during peak periods, also referred to as congestion pricing. Such a policy would raise revenues while reducing traffic congestion, resulting in shorter, more consistent commute times Unfortunately, Blair Lekstrom, B.C. minister of transportation and infra-structure, rejected the proposal, likely because aside from congestion pricing, it also included an increased gas tax, a vehicle registration fee, and a regional carbon tax to fund additional investments in public transit.

But in rejecting the entire proposal, Lekstrom dismissed the best policy prescription for Metro Vancouver’s traffic and transit woes: congestion pricing.

Addendum: I’ve been informed that The Economist made an error in judging Vancouver’s traffic problems.
