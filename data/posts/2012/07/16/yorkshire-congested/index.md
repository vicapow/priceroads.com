According to the satnav firm TomTom, where I live in West Yorkshire has the worst congestion in the UK:

[Drivers in Yorkshire spend 86 hours a year stuck in traffic jams… and even Londoners have it easier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2171252/Drivers-Yorkshire-spend-86-hours-year-stuck-traffic-jams--Londoners-easier.html#ixzz20JObPPSA)

The Leeds-Bradford area is the most congested in Britain, with drivers spending 86 hours a year stuck in jams.

Traffic in the conurbation increases journey times by an average of 28 per cent – and up to 63 per cent in the morning rush hour, a study has found.

I think there must be some difference in methodologies between the Texas Transportation Institute and TomTom. I live in Leeds, and the traffic is nowhere near as bad as where I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. In fact, TTI says Los Angeles drivers only lose about 70 hours per year to traffic jams.

Still, it’s good evidence that the most congested city in the UK is not its only megalopolis, because of congestion pricing.
