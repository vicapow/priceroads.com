[David A. King of Columbia University](http://davidaking.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/now-published-credible-commitment-and.html)thinks revenue recycling is not the key to political acceptance of congestion pricing.

Promises to spend revenue can solve one political problem, because revenue is an easy benefit to understand, but create another one, because revenue is easy to divert. Revenue recycling may therefore not be a promising way to build political support for congestion pricing. We highlight the role commitment problems have played efforts to implement congestion pricing, using examples from around the world and then focusing on California. Because congestion reduction is a more certain benefit than any particular use of the toll revenue, demonstration projects, rather than revenue promises, will be key to pricing’s political success.

This is especially pertinent in today’s political environment, when trust of government is at an all-time low. In fact, I’ve recently read that Tea Partiers believe the smart growth movement was born in 1992 from a UN document called [Agenda 21](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21). Randall O’Toole, opponent of smart growth,[ points out](http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=5973) it has been around since the 70′s. It’s too bad that Smart Growth doesn’t have a birth certificate to show the Tea Partiers.
