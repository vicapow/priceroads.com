From Slate’s Moneybox blog, [Infrastructure Pricing Shouldn’t Maximize Profits](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/04/02/infrasturcture_privatization_leads_to_bad_prices.html)

Now in the real world, publicly owned transportation infrastructure is essentially never priced optimally as I outlined above. So it’s very possible that in practice some jurisdictions are reaping some gains by moving to privatization. But in a structural sense, privatizing your bridges is a step toward locking bad pricing policies in permanently.

Those of us in the pro-pricing camp need to be watchful of privatization deals that could ruin the pricing brand. We need public officials to strike a hard bargain.
