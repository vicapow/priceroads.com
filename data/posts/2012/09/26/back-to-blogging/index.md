I stopped blogging until I’d sorted out a lot of things. There was a lot in the queue…traffic humour.

I left England. I moved to Berkeley to start the MS/PhD in transportation engineering. I finished my old masters dissertation. I got a research advisor (Carlos Daganzo). I got a topic (applying the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram to congestion pricing), which I don’t know if I’m smart enough to pull off but here goes. I just about finished an animation for a new start-up.I turned 26\. I read Dave Egger’s [A Hologram for the King](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FA-Hologram-King-ebook%2Fdp%2FB008FZWLMW&ei=yoJjULHAFvL9yAHCnYHYBQ&usg=AFQjCNG4n1wVXcYpBHXA55s_0cnKe_pJ5A&sig2=DvHC_f_rAvSGpZeN7SeS1A).

Then, last night, I was watching thepremierof New Girl and thought, “If I can watch New Girl, I can drop an hour a week on a blog.” So I’m back.

[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/arts/design/louisville-wrestles-with-freeway-dilemma.html?_r=1&hp=&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1348698516-CPU7RxZM2StZIK4EM5qHaA): “Does Louisville Need More Highways?” This article is good but contains a language error that I’ve corrected:

“Adding more lanesdoesn’tturn out to reduce traffic[travel times]. It increases traffic.”

No one would claim adding capacity reduces flow. The claim is adding capacity reduces travel times.
