			<p>Randall O’Toole, the Antiplanner, provides a valuable public service by opposing wasteful transit. But his messaging could be better. O’Toole is at his best when promoting buses as superior to rail and streetcars. He is least effective when telling communities they fundamentally shouldn’t want what they want.&nbsp;In his recent post on San Antonio’s streetcars, O’Toole <a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=7198">points out</a>:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My report showed that streetcars are just plain inferior to buses in every possible way. They are slower; can’t carry as many people per hour; prone to system failure (if one is disabled, every car on the line has to stop); can’t easily respond to changes in travel habits; and are far more expensive than buses.</p>

<p>That’s something your concerned citizen can get on board with. You want to build transit? Well, buses are your best option.&nbsp;However, O’Toole’s arguments about bus advantages are overshadowed in the news. Here is what<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Both-sides-rail-over-planned-streetcars-4073905.php#ixzz2E6s7ANQd"> got reported</a>:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Antonio, he said, “is a modern city, and it doesn’t need a downtown.”</p>

<p>Hmmm. My guess is that a radical opinion like this taints&nbsp;all&nbsp;of your arguments in the eyes of someone concerned about their community as a singular, aesthetically satisfying entity–like people who hold sway these matters tend to do. O’Toole’s statement is couched against the following:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news%2Flocal_news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Lynn+Knapik%22">Lynn Knapik</a>, 65, who moved downtown two years ago, leaving behind her house and North Side living. She’s single; her children are grown; and for the first time in her life, she feels like she lives in a neighborhood.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Streetcar would be like the icing on the cake, she said. A Realtor, Knapik imagined taking her clients on the streetcar to tour downtown residences.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Plus,” she said, “you’d be selling the whole lifestyle of it.”</p>

<p>Now it’s Professor Outsider McThinkTank against an elderly business-lady with a dream and a cake metaphor. Here and in other coverage, reporters highlight the fact O’Toole opposes all public transit subsidies. O’Toole is also very honest and intellectual in his dealings with the public. He&nbsp;could&nbsp;get more done by vaguer thoughts that don’t condemn streetcars outright but rather make San Antonio seem like a very special case where they won’t work:</p>
<p>“San Antonio is special, and it deserves home-grown&nbsp;solutions. One size&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;fit all. I don’t know if you’ve checked the weather forecast this morning, but it’s safe to say&nbsp;I’m not in Oregon anymore&nbsp;[chuckles from the crowd]. San Antonio needs to build on home-grown&nbsp;success stories like the cutting edge&nbsp;Primo bus rapid transit system.”</p>
<p>I run into this all the time even in my daily life. I help my parents manage their money, and my dad will never ever believe that index funds do just as well as managed funds. I tried explaining this to him a couple of times, and he can’t get over the idea that a man who went to Harvard reading the Wall Street Journal will make lots of money with magical judgement calls. What my dad wants, fundamentally, is to be able to think about somebody smart fretting over his money. Since he wants this, I got him into some very low fee Vanguard funds.</p>

			<p>Yesterday in my land use class we were going over Smart Growth policies, and it occurred to me that the deregulation part of the Smart Growth agenda should be independently branded for conservative/libertarian consumption. That aspect is comprised of eliminating minimum parking requirements while easing height limits, minimum lot sizes, setbacks, restrictions on multifamily housing, etc. “This could be so easy to market!” I thought.</p>
<p>After doing a search I find Bryan Caplan already <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/11/free_to_build_t.html">beat me to the point</a>:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How about this: A populist movement to drastically reduce the price of housing by slashing the regulatory barriers to new construction? Uh oh, it still sounds like an egghead is talking. Real populism means sound bytes. My best shot so far:&nbsp;Free to Build.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Here are some preliminary slogans:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“You shouldn’t have to be rich to buy a nice home.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Think of our children! They deserve homes of their own too.” (And if you remain convinced that voters are selfish, try “Do you want your kids to live with your until they’re 40?!”)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(For privately-owned land) “They own it, why can’t they do something useful with it?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(For publicly-owned land) “We own it, why can’t we do something useful with it?”</p>

<p>I can imagine the commercials running in my home state of Alabama:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Open on an elderly, African American homeowner lady (Eleanor) and a property developer (Ben) in a tie cause he’s professional but with his sleeves rolled up cause he gets the job done.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“When the jobs went away, my savings all but dried up,” she says over a “For Sale” sign and a brief shot of Obama smoking. “Then Ben approached me.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We let her know we could build folks some real nice condos and even create a few jobs on the way,” says Ben over shots of Caterpillars and construction workers eating out of metal lunchboxes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cut to black and white of an office with a feeble Poindexter pushing paper at a desk. His sleeves are notably down and festooned with&nbsp;cuff links.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Narrator: “But government bureaucrats won’t let Ben build on Eleanor’s land.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Unfortunately, city hall ruled that condos were too good for Homewood,” says Ben. “That it would harm the&nbsp;character.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We can’t just let people do what they want with their land!” says the bureaucrat speaking with the effete intonation of a New England Brahmin.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I don’t know&nbsp;what&nbsp;I’m going to leave my grand kids now,”&nbsp;cries Eleanor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Narrator: “Let big government planners they work for TAXPAYERS like YOU! Vote Yes on Amendment 12.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;It would also help to somehow identify the practice of &nbsp;zoning with France (Le Cobusier?), Chicago Politics, or latte’s. It is impossible to overdo a political ad in Alabama, where the TV climate approaches Super Bowl levels of awesomeness during campaign season:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“We’ve put a lot of money, with the cooperation of the federal government, into the creation of our HOV lanes. We want to make sure they’re used as much as possible, getting a good return for our investment.&nbsp;And what this program allows us to do is get more use out of them at times when they otherwise might not be used to capacity. At the same time, we’re giving people the opportunity to get a little faster trip.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suppose this is the best way to justify HOT lanes to the average person: we are filling up the HOV lanes.</p>

<div id="disqus_title">
<p>Texas Feral Hog Wrecks Mark Losing Battle With Animals</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Even before the fastest highway in the U.S. opened, collisions began. Feral hogs were on the move.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Police report at least four such wrecks on the 85 mile (137 kilometer) per hour stretch since traffic began flowing Oct. 24…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The newly opened 41-mile toll-road stretch, built by units of <a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FER:SM">Ferrovial SA (FER)</a> and Zachry Corp. and run as a concession, costs as much as $8.21 for a passenger car to travel its length. Highway operators are putting up wildlife-crossing signs to warn drivers, said Chris Lippincott, a spokesman.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Curbing the hog threat probably will require toll-road officials and the state to work with neighboring landowners on trapping the pigs and erecting stronger fences or barricades, Higginbotham said.</p>

<p>I don’t know who to root for here. Pigs are my favorite animals but toll roads are my favorite roads.</p>

			<p>The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) is continuing its campaign to actually&nbsp;convince&nbsp;people that congestion pricing is a good idea. Randy Blankenhorn, Executive Director of CMAP, has written a <a href="http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/opinions/letters/16515024-474/letters-congestion-pricing-a-boon.html">letter-to-the-editor</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With congestion pricing, toll rates in express lanes rise at times when more drivers want to use the highway and fall when demand is low. Supply and demand will help manage highway resources more effectively. CMAP has created www.cmap.illinois.gov/congestion-pricing, with information about the benefits to our region’s residents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the past 20 years, 10 states have successfully implemented congestion pricing, and public support has increased as drivers become familiar with it. While express-lane revenue could help pay for some of a roadway’s costs, the primary goal of congestion pricing is to manage traffic more effectively.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With construction approaching for two new expressways and new lanes on existing ones, now is the time for our state and region to make a strong commitment to congestion pricing. It’s a crucial step to shorten travel times and maximize the benefit of these planned improvements.</p>

			<p>This is big news:</p>
<p>— In what it’s calling one of the most ambitious efforts in the nation, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission plans to convert to all-electronic tolling within five years, scrapping the need for drivers to pass through tollbooths.</p>
<p>They’re using cameras for people without EZ-Pass. Not everyone is a winner, though, and I doubt this would have happened if the state government were Democratic:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Turnpike currently employs 755 unionized toll collectors, along with 100 nonunion employees, who’d be out of a job if the transition happens, according to published reports. It costs about $67 million a year to run the toll plazas, with the cost rising to $77 million by 2014, those reports indicated.</p>

			<p>In this <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/09/local/la-me-1109-toll-lane-opens-20121110">LA Times story</a> I found the following potentially false hope:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Transportation officials and some experts say the 110 Freeway experiment is a long-overdue, winning improvement that should benefit all drivers. It will reduce travel times for those willing to pay, they predict, and relieve congestion on the remainder of the freeway as solo commuters shift out of those lanes.</p>

<p>There’s not much evidence the express lanes will substantially ease congestion. For a while, some solo drivers will divert into the tolled lanes, but probably not enough to have a big impact. And demand in the free lanes is a function of congestion, so demand will rise enough to mitigate any congestion relief. Lastly, when the solo drivers merge with regular traffic it creates a big bottleneck. I recently did a detector data project showing that the SR91 HOT lanes in Orange County have a huge bottleneck when the HOT lanes end, as the solo drivers change lanes.</p>
<p>The real advantage of express lanes is the time savings of people who use it and, to some degree, the option value that everyone else gains. But even in a culture as allegedly individualistic as America, express lanes have to be marketing in terms of their congestion savings to the whole group. I worry, though, that this marketing strategy will backfire when opponents start asking, “Where is the congestion relief you promised?” at the end of the trial. This is a sore point on the despised Atlanta HOT lanes.</p>
<p>The 495 Express Lanes are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-state-of-nova/post/here-come-the-beltway-hot-lanes--you-ready/2012/11/16/c1aaa2fc-2f9f-11e2-9f50-0308e1e75445_blog.html">opening in DC</a> on Novemeber 17th. This is a very big deal, because America’s bureaucrats and political tastemakers will finally have first-hand experience with the idea. Unfortunately, the 495 express lanes are compromised by a forced merge when they get to the beltway, which will substantially neutralize the savings for both their customers and the general traffic.</p>

			<p>The 110 in LA has express lanes as of Saturday.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/la-110-freeway-toll-lanes-smooth-start.html">L.A.’s first freeway toll lanes off to smooth start, officials say</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tolls vary from 25 cents to $1.40 a mile, depending on congestion and demand. Officials aim to keep travel speeds in the express lanes at least 45 miles per hour. They estimate the average toll for a motorist will be between $4 and $7 a trip, although it could be as much as $15.40. Officials estimate the lanes could save&nbsp; motorists as much as two to three minutes a mile.</p>

<p>These are pretty expensive rates. If you paid $15.40 for 11 miles and saved 2.5 minutes/mile that’d be about $30/hour value of travel time savings. The express lanes are a pilot meant to last one year. Like other express lanes, the authorities are targeting speeds instead of flows.</p>

											<a href="http://priceroads.com/2012/11/05/resiliency-in-nyc/">800px-New_York_Subway (1)</a>
				            
			<p>The Antiplanner has a bold <a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=7092">policy recommendatio</a>n for NYC:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are two alternatives to rebuilding the subways. The drastic alternative is to simply let the city fend for itself without subways. A more realistic alternative would be to convert the subways into underground busways. Electric buses could move just about as many people as the subways do with far less infrastructure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Battery-powered buses in particular would require almost no infrastructure other than rechargers (and the tunnels themselves, of course, which as far as I know weren’t damaged by the storm). At eighteen feet in height, the tunnels are tall enough for double-decker buses, which should be able to move about as many people per hour as the subway trains. With minimal added infrastructure, the buses could even be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/environmental_rep/03/jigyou02.html">driverless</a>, making them far less expensive to operate and maintain than rails.</p>

<p>Being a small government advocate, O’Toole has a dog in this fight: he believes it would save a lot of money. Apart from size-of-government issues, we should also examine the rail/bus trade-off through the lens of resiliency.</p>
<p>First, resiliency is good marketing. Economists are fond of talking about cost-effectiveness of buses, but cost-effectiveness does not actually mean anything to most voters, who do not believe in fungibility of funding and have never in the history of policy been impressed with the phrase “revenue neutral.” Resiliency is something voters can understand.</p>
<p>Second, resiliency is a hot topic in light of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">Nassim Taleb</a>‘s (Black Swan bro) work popularizing the importance of&nbsp;inconceivably&nbsp;random events.</p>
<p>It seems that an electrically-powered bus system would be far more resilient than a rail system. Both&nbsp;require&nbsp;electricity, but buses require less fixed-cost infrastructure, which is expensive to replace in the event of earthquake/hurricane/terrorist attack. Buses also require less specialized labor, and there are far more suppliers of bus parts and&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;than rail parts and maintenance.</p>
<p>I have also thought of what it would mean for resiliency if Mayor Bloomberg’s congestion pricing scheme had been implemented but come to no obvious conclusions.</p>
