<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[At White Water Atlanta] Some guests simply queue up for their rides. Those who purchase green-and-gold wrist bands – fitted with radio frequency technology – are able to swim in the pool or eat snacks before being alerted to their turn.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Guests who pay an even higher fee – roughly double the price of admission – get the gold flash pass, cutting their waiting time in half.</div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The company says it has been a huge hit and is now installing the system in all of its American water parks.</p>

			<p><a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/to-reduce-congestion-imagine-the-government-charged-by-the-kilometre-10035">Kilometre-based charging</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My colleagues (Professors Bliemer and Mulley) and I suggest that this can be achieved by lowering vehicle registration fees together with a distance-based charging regime. Such a package can deliver financial gains to motorists with potential for revenue growth to the State Treasury of Sydney…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We see this as an essential first stage in gaining community support for road pricing reform. Proof of cost reductions associated with improvements in traffic congestion can then be used to continue the reform process…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This road pricing reform plan would require drivers to purchase an on-board unit (approximately $50 one-off cost), that will record the kilometres by time of day. The off-peak kilometres are not charged, but peak kilometres will be charged at the agreed rate.</p>

<p>David Henscher is a giant of the field, and it’s good to see people thinking about politically acceptable ways to price roads. My current research is about a cordon scheme whereby you can get a rebate for time spent parked.</p>

			<p>The mayor of Buenos Aires, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Macri">Mauricio Macri</a>, has been introducing variable pricing on the freeways (<a href="http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-199958-2012-07-31.html">link in Spanish</a>). He’s introducing 20% increases in average tolls, although it’s hard to say how much this is in real terms because Argentina has such high inflation. Also, the authorities are claiming the reason for toll increases is too raise money for the highways. One thing that’s important is that they’re being&nbsp;transparent&nbsp;about the goals:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">El argumento para cobrar más en los horarios pico fue similar al que había utilizado el ex jefe de Gobierno Jorge Telerman cuando decidió no cobrarles a los vehículos con cuatro ocupantes o más: desincentivar el tránsito en los momentos de mayor congestión. Rápidamente quedó claro que, pese al peaje más caro, entraba la misma cantidad de autos a la ciudad, pero Macri mantuvo esa diferenciación, que le reportó mayores ingresos a AUSA, la empresa que depende del gobierno porteño.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/02/the_scourge_of_garbage_in_garbage_out_research_on_innovation.html">Matt Yglesias</a> makes some good points about patenting, but also draws attention to this innovation:</p>
<div>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As an example, my favorite place to get lunch by my office is&nbsp;<a href="http://choptsalad.com/" target="_blank">Chopt</a>&nbsp;a small NYC/DC salad chain that’s engaged in a lot of interesting business model innovation. One thing they do is that at peak demand times when the store gets crowded and things get hectic, they employ a guy to serve as a kind of “traffic cop” who directs customers to the optimal line to order at.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This might be a good idea or might be a bad one. But if it’s working for them, it’s a real example of TFP-boosting innovation. It does, yes, involve adding a little bit of extra labor (the traffic cop) to the production function. But it’s not highly skilled labor. And the point of it isn’t a linear addition where you have one extra guy making salads. Instead the idea is that at peak demand times, employing a traffic cop lets everyone work more efficiently. The same stock of labor (cashiers, salad-makers) and capital (physical space, mezzalunas, cash registers) is producing more salads by having the customers flow more efficiently through the space. And yet this innovation is not patentable and it would be a public policy disaster to grant a patent for it.</p>

<p>It’d be cool to model the flow here.</p>

			<p>I stopped blogging until I’d sorted out a lot of things. There was a lot in the queue…traffic humour.</p>
<p>I left England. I moved to Berkeley to start the MS/PhD in transportation engineering. I finished my old masters dissertation. I got a research advisor (Carlos Daganzo). I got a topic (applying the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram to congestion pricing), which I don’t know if I’m smart enough to pull off but here goes. I just about finished an animation for a new start-up.&nbsp;I turned 26. I read Dave Egger’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FA-Hologram-King-ebook%2Fdp%2FB008FZWLMW&ei=yoJjULHAFvL9yAHCnYHYBQ&usg=AFQjCNG4n1wVXcYpBHXA55s_0cnKe_pJ5A&sig2=DvHC_f_rAvSGpZeN7SeS1A">A Hologram for the King</a>.</p>
<p>Then, last night, I was watching the&nbsp;premier&nbsp;of New Girl and thought, “If I can watch New Girl, I can drop an hour a week on a blog.” So I’m back.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/arts/design/louisville-wrestles-with-freeway-dilemma.html?_r=1&hp=&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1348698516-CPU7RxZM2StZIK4EM5qHaA">New York Times</a>: “Does Louisville Need More Highways?” This article is good but contains a language error that I’ve corrected:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Adding more lanes&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;turn out to reduce traffic&nbsp;[travel times]. It increases traffic.”</p>
<p>No one would claim adding capacity reduces flow. The claim is adding capacity reduces travel times.</p>

			<p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/clifford-whinston-on-driverless-cars.html">Marginal Revolution</a> has passages from this gated WSJ piece by Clifford Winston of Brookings:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Driverless cars don’t need the same wide lanes, which would allow highway authorities to reconfigure roads to allow travel speeds to be raised during peak travel periods. All that is needed would be illuminated lane dividers that can increase the number of lanes available. Driverless cars could take advantage of the extra lane capacity to reduce congestion and delays.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another design flaw is that highways have been built in terms of width and thickness to accommodate both cars and trucks. The smaller volume of trucks should be handled with one or two wide lanes with a road surface about a foot thick, to withstand trucks’ weight and axle pressure. But the much larger volume of cars—which apply much less axle pressure that damages pavement—need more and narrower lanes that are only a few inches thick.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Building highways that separate cars and trucks by directing them to lanes with the appropriate thickness would save taxpayers a bundle. It would also favor the technology of driverless cars because they would not have to distinguish between cars and trucks and to adjust speeds and positions accordingly.</p>

<p>Differentiating lanes strikes me as exactly the kind of innovation we would expect from a private road operator. However, governments have already shown willingness to differentiate lanes by use, such as HOT lanes, HOV lanes, bus lanes and bikes lanes.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how likely it is that we’ll see lane-widths changed in response to driverless vehicles. Although no one would mind the equilibrium after the change, it’s the move that matters. It’s hard to tell people “cars are safer, so we’re going to make the roads more dangerous,” even though there is a continuum of lanes wider than the existing widths that no one is especially pushing for…as if the current lane width were magically just right.</p>
<p>Consider that America still hasn’t adopted the metric system.</p>

			<p><a href="http://davidaking.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/now-published-credible-commitment-and.html">David A. King of Columbia University</a>&nbsp;thinks revenue recycling is not the key to political acceptance of congestion pricing.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;Promises to spend revenue can solve one political problem, because revenue is an easy benefit to understand, but create another one, because revenue is easy to divert. Revenue recycling may therefore not be a promising way to build political support for congestion pricing. We highlight the role commitment problems have played efforts to implement congestion pricing, using examples from around the world and then focusing on California. Because congestion reduction is a more certain benefit than any particular use of the toll revenue, demonstration projects, rather than revenue promises, will be key to pricing’s political success.</p>

<p>This is especially pertinent in today’s political environment, when trust of government is at an all-time low. In fact, I’ve recently read that Tea Partiers believe the smart growth movement was born in 1992 from a UN document called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21">Agenda 21</a>. Randall O’Toole, opponent of smart growth,<a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=5973"> points out</a> it has been around since the 70′s. It’s too bad that Smart Growth doesn’t have a birth certificate to show the Tea Partiers.</p>

			<p>Brendon Slotterbock at Net Density totally nails an argument I’ve felt for a long time but haven’t been able to put into words. For the unschooled: his critique is directed at a growing, as-yet-unnamed movement of progressive and libertarian pundits who would like to relax zoning in urban areas. The advantages would be higher density and affordable housing.</p>
<p><a href="http://netdensity.net/2012/07/03/2765/">A challenge to the market-oriented urbanists</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">More calls for density based on market forces, fine.&nbsp; But what almost every single one of these articles seems to lack is any robust exploration of&nbsp;how&nbsp;zoning rules are adopted, enforced, and changed and&nbsp;what exactly&nbsp;the author proposes as an alternative.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zoning laws are made by men and women and enforced by same, often times by existing landowners who are risk- and change-averse.&nbsp; How often has this scene played out across America: 1) Developer buys property 2) Developer decides that in order to make profit, he/she must build something that is larger than zoning allows 3) He/she goes to neighborhood board/zoning board to ask for rezoning or variance 4) Neighbors howl that the building is too tall/will generate too much traffic 5) Zoning board caves or developer backs out 6) Project doesn’t get built or is downsized.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no single authority, no dusty bureaucrat simply refusing to pull the magic zoning lever that will unleash the benevolent market forces.</p>

<p>The last sentence is almost a reverse Hayek critique. &nbsp;Hayek claimed that government planning (socialism) would fail, because there were no simple levers to pull. The economy is mostly a “spontaneous order,” the outcome of the decentralized decisions of thousands of individuals who don’t know each other or even understand what their role in a larger process is. Central planners of the 30′s-60′s operated as though there were representative individuals who could be persuaded or coerced.</p>
<p>The irony here is supreme. When Yglesias and Stephen Smith rail against government intervention in local housing, they ignore the actual &nbsp;fermentation of reactionary policy. Bad zoning codes are the outcomes of the decentralized actions of thousands of local preservationists,&nbsp;&nbsp;classists, racists, and general busibodies. My father is an urban planner (focus on environmental planning, e.g. flood plains), and I recall going to community meetings with him when I was young, in which the craziest people in the&nbsp;neighbourhood&nbsp;would show up to rant and rave about issues he couldn’t possibly affect. Local policy is inherently messy, because the people who have the most free time have the most voice.</p>
<p>Complaining about bad policy is important, but there should be a next step: designing a viable strategy to overturn them. The greatest piece of political&nbsp;entrepreneurship&nbsp;of our time is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_Top">Race to the Top</a> program, in which Obama made it possible for local education reformers to pit teachers unions against children in a zero-sum grab for federal cash. This was brilliant, cheap, and resulted in a widespread, permanent loss of union power. Taxi deregulation is proceeding mainly via lawsuits on behalf of people with disabilities. ObamaCare succeeded in part by&nbsp;guaranteeing&nbsp;doctors and insurers a supply of customers/end to insane pre-existing conditions checkwork w/o insurance death spiral.</p>
<p>In all these cases, policy&nbsp;entrepreneurs&nbsp;identified a group and advertised a salient benefit to the group. So far, the market urbanists have advertised low-income people as the beneficiaries of relaxed zoning. But low-income people will never understand their arguments, nor are they politically powerful overall. And most importantly, the people who would like to live in the&nbsp;neighbourhood&nbsp;are not represented in its politics until they actually do live there.</p>
<p>So here is my proposal: market urbanists should market housing deregulation to public unions. These are the most politically powerful force in every city where over-zoning is significant (San Francisco, New York, DC, Boston). As monopoly providers of local services, public unions benefit from the expansion of their market via population growth. More growth means more work to do and more property taxes for compensation. And since public unions tend to back-load their benefit plans–hitting up future taxpayers–they have a very long-term interest in the population growth of the city. Finally, public unions already have an infrastructure for explaining complicated topics to their members and ensuring people vote correctly.</p>
<p>I think this would be best way since Pabst Blue Ribbon to connect the “young, white collar, Teach-for-America, basketball-watching, Google Reader” segment of the Democratic Party to the “middle-aged, blue collar, hockey-watching, Pixburgh is the greatest country on earth” segment.</p>

			<p>According to the satnav firm TomTom, where I live in West Yorkshire has the worst congestion in the UK:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2171252/Drivers-Yorkshire-spend-86-hours-year-stuck-traffic-jams--Londoners-easier.html#ixzz20JObPPSA">Drivers in Yorkshire spend 86 hours a year stuck in traffic jams… and even Londoners have it easier</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Leeds-Bradford area is the most congested in Britain, with drivers spending 86 hours a year stuck in jams.<br>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Traffic in the conurbation increases journey times by an average of 28 per cent – and up to 63 per cent in the morning rush hour, a study has found.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;Even Londoners have it easier, with drivers in the capital spending 74 hours a year in jams.</div>

<p>I think there must be some difference in methodologies between the Texas Transportation Institute and TomTom. I live in Leeds, and the traffic is nowhere near as bad as where I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. In fact, TTI says Los Angeles drivers only lose about 70 hours per year to traffic jams.</p>
<p>Still, it’s good evidence that the most congested city in the UK is not its only megalopolis, because of congestion pricing.</p>
