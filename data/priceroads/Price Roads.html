			<p>Excellent accessibility ranking by Dr. David Levinson (the T<a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/levin031/transportationist/">ransportationist</a>) and the Nexus Research Group at University of Minnesota:</p>
<p></p>
<p>California has the #1 and #2 most accessible cities, and they provide an interesting contrast in two ways to get accessibility. Accessibility can come from density (everything is close together so it doesn’t take long to go from one place to another) or mobility (everything is far apart but there are huge highways so you can traverse long distances).</p>
<p>I’m excited to see academics using visual media to put across point about public policy.</p>

			<p>from the New York Times (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/us/to-fight-gridlock-los-angeles-synchronizes-every-red-light.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">link</a>)</p>
<p>The system uses magnetic sensors in the road that measure the flow of traffic, hundreds of cameras and a centralized computer system that makes constant adjustments to keep cars moving as smoothly as possible. The city’s Transportation Department says the average speed of traffic across the city is 16 percent faster under the system, with delays at major intersections down 12 percent.</p>
<p>The improvements are presented as a boost to speed. There are two other metrics to consider: First, I’d like to see an estimate of the boost to flow; that is, a measure of the number of additional trips that can now reach downtown Los Angeles in a given hour. <a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~ksmall/EndogenSchedPrefs.pdf">Fosgerau and Small</a> (2012) suggests we probably underestimate the benefits of getting people in and out of downtowns simultaneously. When there is variable capacity, as in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_flow#Macroscopic_Fundamental_Diagram">Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram</a> framework, these could be big gains.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another metric I’d like to see is accessibility, which is so important we should have a <a href="http://netdensity.net/2013/02/12/2989/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NetDensity+%28Net+Density%29">Department of Accessibility</a>. At the University of California Transportation Center conference in LA last month, I saw <a href="http://taubmancollege.umich.edu/faculty/directory/?sel=169">Dr. Jonathan Levine</a> of U. Michigan make a convincing presentation that mobility measures (speed increases) are really only useful to the extent they represent gains in accessibility; that accessibility is the be-all-end-all of transport policy. The problem with capturing accessibility improvements for a city is that its metrics are specific to Origin-Destination pairs typically, so there is no general “marginal accessibility” improvement that you could tell a reporter. You would just present a map with changing colors on it I guess.</p>

			<p>Issi Romem, a fellow grad student here at Berkeley whom I’ve never met, draws attention to the impact of driverless vehicles on urban form: (<a href="http://cityminded.org/how-will-driverless-cars-affect-our-cities-6526">link</a>)</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Cities will greatly expand, again:</b>&nbsp;Faster and more efficient transportation will convert locations that are currently too remote for most users into feasible alternatives, abundant with space. Like suburban rail in the early twentieth century and the mass consumer automobile that followed, driverless cars will generate a gradual, but dramatic expansion of cities.</li>
<li><b>Buildings and parking will be uncoupled, freeing up valuable land:&nbsp;</b>After dropping off passengers, driverless cars will independently seek parking (or their next car-share customers) and they will show up for the return ride at the tap of an app. As soon as driverless cars are common enough, the demand for adjacent parking will dwindle and parking lots in areas where land is sufficiently valuable will be ripe for conversion to other land use. As parking in high-value areas is thinned out or altogether purged, the micro-structure of cities will change – you guessed it – dramatically!</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I disagree with Romem’s predictions for engineering reasons. I know what he’s thinking: the price of distance drops, so people consume more distance. But there is more here than meets the eye.</p>
<p>First, travel time is consumed not in traversing&nbsp;distance but rather in traversing&nbsp;queues. To the degree they enable higher speeds and reduce accidents,&nbsp;autonomous&nbsp;vehicles will merely allow us to ore frequently rub the fundamental capacity&nbsp;constraints&nbsp;of bottlenecks. Capacities of existing bottlenecks will certainly rise with AV’s, but I have not seen evidence they will rise much in mixed traffic with both AV’s and non-AV’s.</p>
<p>To put it another way, the automobile allowed sprawl because it went faster&nbsp;and&nbsp;because authorities expanded the network with automobiles in mind. If authorities had kept our pre-automobile network in place, the speed and reliability of the invention would quickly run up against the limits of the infrastructure, and almost the entirety of any trip would have been spent at intersections or accelerating and decelerating</p>
<p>Therefore,&nbsp;AV’s will only beget sprawl if authorities supply more capacity at bottlenecks–which doesn’t seem to currently interest our DOT’s as much as network expansion–or if authorities change roadscapes specifically for AV’s by changing the lane widths. I believe this is unlikely because of status quo bias and loss aversion on the part of the non-AV minority. Modern transportation policy, increasingly democratic, is very much guided by the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness">difference&nbsp;principle</a>.</p>
<p>Second, if cars are really going to be in service all the time, there are large gains to locating near other origins and destinations. AV sharing will exhibit the same economies as bike sharing and taxi service. If I live in rural CA my car might take a while, and every minute it travels deadheaded on the trip to pick up me in my far-flung location is another minute of money cost I accrue.</p>
<p>Finally, major sprawl periods occur when population grows. Except for the crime-driven exodus of the 60′s through 80′s, my understanding is that sprawl has typically happened when people immigrated from rural to metropolitan areas or from other countries. Philadelphia is famous for the starfish pattern the streetcar left on it, but I doubt that the streetcar actually decreased the population of its inner city much. People have overestimated the “flight” cause of sprawl relative to the immigration tendency.</p>
<p>One thing I believe we would agree on is that scale transit will become obsolete.</p>

			<p>Arlington, VA is spending about $1 million each for 24 bus stops: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57576724/$1m-exposed-d.c.-area-bus-stop-leaves-straphangers-out-in-the-rain/">link</a>. Each has room to shield about 15 people, although not very well.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 616px"><p class="wp-caption-text">$1 million bus stop; Washington Post</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-24/local/37989853_1_bus-shelter-new-bus-streetcars">Post</a>&nbsp;says that federal and state money paid for 80% of the cost. It’s an old story: other people’s money.</p>
<p>Transportation funding might not change. So what could lower the ceteris paribus cost of infrastructure? Clearly, local government will always be sloppy with other people’s money, but a imprudence has different results at Wal-Mart than at Tiffany’s.</p>
<p>Over the past century, Americans have gotten way better at making food, electronics, and cars. On a per-unit-of-input basis, we’ve gotten worse at higher education, basic health care and government construction. What stands out here is that everything bespoke has gotten more expensive and gold-plated.</p>
<p>Economists would point to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol" s_cost_disease"="">Baumol’s cost disease</a>, but I think we should really look at technological improvement in rent-seeking. Clearly, over many years of working government projects, a contractor will get better at something profitable. Will it learn to make a given quality of bus stop with the least labor and material? Or will it learn to capture more and larger contracts with the same labor and material? It looks like the latter has been more profitable.</p>
<p>I think the only way ahead is to substitute mass-produced projects for bespoke ones. A giant firm selling alike projects to thousands of governments really might profit from cutting costs and prices. For construction, this model is harder than it is for toys. Construction requires “boots on the ground” and hence local firms and hence monopolistic bidding and rent-seeking.</p>
<p>But given the surplus here is tremendous, I think someone will find a way to take a bite of it with lower costs. By surplus I mean not merely the profits in the construction industry but the immense societal gains of building more and better infrastructure…time saved, lives saved, stress reduced, communities beautified. We are already seeing tiny points of light in highway construction, through a field called “accelerated construction.” Here is a <a href="http://http//www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/us/rapid-construction-techniques-transform-infrastructure-repair.html?pagewanted=all">New York Times article</a> about a bridge built out of pre-made parts in&nbsp;Massachusetts. <a href="http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/construction/accelerated/">Here</a> is an FHWA site about the practice. I sincerely hope mass production of infrastructure proceeds apace.</p>

			<p>Over at Market Urbanism, Emily Washington <a href="http://marketurbanism.com/2013/03/07/many-market-urbanist-elements-in-dcs-zoning-rewrite/">compiles all the land deregulation</a> coming to Washington, DC. It’s good news for <a href="http://www.vtpi.org/access.pdf">accessibility</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration">agglomeration</a>&nbsp;economies and affordable housing.</p>
<p>Urban land deregulation&nbsp;(allowing tall buildings, eliminating minimum parking requirements, letting people put apartments in their garages) is an uphill battle right now, but I predict it will come about more quickly than meets the eye. Social science variables, especially deregulation, tend to form sigmoid curves. Sigmoid curves have flat slopes at first–meaning little change happens every year–but then wax quickly. And there has never been a slow deregulation.</p>
<div id="attachment_1042" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 587px"><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://priceroads.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sigmoid-01.jpg">sigmoid-01</a><p class="wp-caption-text">a sigmoid curve</p></div>
<p>We see fast deregulation today with with gay marriage and immigration and charter schools. America freed 100% of millions of slaves in five years. Britain privatized nearly 100% of its bus service between 1985 and 1988. In the other direction, regulation proceeded just as breathlessly in the Progressive Era and New Deal/WWII.</p>
<p>Here I’m engaging in “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting">reference class forecasting</a>,” meaning comparing a phenomenon to others in its class rather than staring at its particulars. Because humans–me included–are story-telling machines with terrible biases toward availability and representativeness, I’m skeptical of analyzing the facts of a social science situation too much. But I’ll give it a shot:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ten years ago, land deregulation was barely on the agenda. Now, it’s creeping up the docket. Politicians are at least cognizant that respectable people support it, and NIMBY is familiar slander. Add to the mix: universal&nbsp;support&nbsp;among the academics who train planners, the sanctity of “cutting emissions” as a justification for urban policy, falling crime rates, expensive housing, and higher tolerance of all types. In contrast, there are&nbsp;zero&nbsp;trends supporting&nbsp;more&nbsp;land deregulation. There are <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/schleicher_david">acclaimed&nbsp;professors</a>who think about how to upzone urban land all day, but none who do the opposite.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since there are no reasons to expect more regulations and many reasons for less of it, expect less of it. And since social science variables never move linearly, expect lots of deregulation happening quickly in some undeterminable year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most pundits are inept at thinking beyond first-order changes (the blue tangent lines). They make a prediction based on current slope, then revise it upward or downward every so often.</p>

<p>(Note: this post is not about whether HSR is a good idea; it’s about how citizens come to that conclusion.)</p>
<p>When I first started studying transportation engineering, people would always try to relate by saying something good-natured like, “It’s a crime we don’t have high speed rail in this country.” One thing that struck me is that, although tons of young people in California love the idea of high speed rail, none know what the ticket prices, headways, or even travel times will be. This might not seem too odd, at first. How could they be expected to know every detail of a future system?</p>
<p>But the more I thought about it, the more bizarre it seemed. Price, travel time and headway are sin qua non in every single demand model for a simple reason: this trio is the fabric of the user experience of transit. They are not details but rather the&nbsp;only rational reasons you should want high-speed rail. Either (a) you want to enjoy these advantages of HSR yourself or (b) you want other people to shift out of planes and automobiles because&nbsp;they&nbsp;want to enjoy its superior price/travel time/headway combination. And, you can Google search to find out these details in about a minute.</p>
<p>If people are not merely uninformed but genuinely&nbsp;unconcerned&nbsp;about the actual experience of riding around on HSR, then why do they want it? Three things everyone I’ve talked with&nbsp;does&nbsp;know about HSR is (a) how fast it goes; (b) other countries have it; and (c) it’s greener than driving or flying. Since these are all people have to base their decision on, I assume people support HSR mainly because &nbsp;(a) it’s awesome to think about; (b) America should have what other countries have; and (c) we should recognize the reality of climate change.</p>
<p>I say “recognizing the reality of climate change,” not about actually curbing emissions, because in order to believe HSR would be&nbsp;successful&nbsp;at curbing emissions you’d have to know something about its ridership and hence its user experience. Moreover, in one of my city planning classes last semester we read all the facts and critiques of HSR in California, and when the teacher asked who still supported it, one very intelligent classmate said, “We need to start&nbsp;doing something&nbsp;about climate change in this country.” This was despite the fact we had really only been presented with evidence that&nbsp;undercut claims of HSR’s emission-reducing power.</p>

			<p>Randall O’Toole, the Antiplanner, provides a valuable public service by opposing wasteful transit. But his messaging could be better. O’Toole is at his best when promoting buses as superior to rail and streetcars. He is least effective when telling communities they fundamentally shouldn’t want what they want.&nbsp;In his recent post on San Antonio’s streetcars, O’Toole <a href="http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=7198">points out</a>:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My report showed that streetcars are just plain inferior to buses in every possible way. They are slower; can’t carry as many people per hour; prone to system failure (if one is disabled, every car on the line has to stop); can’t easily respond to changes in travel habits; and are far more expensive than buses.</p>

<p>That’s something your concerned citizen can get on board with. You want to build transit? Well, buses are your best option.&nbsp;However, O’Toole’s arguments about bus advantages are overshadowed in the news. Here is what<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Both-sides-rail-over-planned-streetcars-4073905.php#ixzz2E6s7ANQd"> got reported</a>:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">San Antonio, he said, “is a modern city, and it doesn’t need a downtown.”</p>

<p>Hmmm. My guess is that a radical opinion like this taints&nbsp;all&nbsp;of your arguments in the eyes of someone concerned about their community as a singular, aesthetically satisfying entity–like people who hold sway these matters tend to do. O’Toole’s statement is couched against the following:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news%2Flocal_news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Lynn+Knapik%22">Lynn Knapik</a>, 65, who moved downtown two years ago, leaving behind her house and North Side living. She’s single; her children are grown; and for the first time in her life, she feels like she lives in a neighborhood.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Streetcar would be like the icing on the cake, she said. A Realtor, Knapik imagined taking her clients on the streetcar to tour downtown residences.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Plus,” she said, “you’d be selling the whole lifestyle of it.”</p>

<p>Now it’s Professor Outsider McThinkTank against an elderly business-lady with a dream and a cake metaphor. Here and in other coverage, reporters highlight the fact O’Toole opposes all public transit subsidies. O’Toole is also very honest and intellectual in his dealings with the public. He&nbsp;could&nbsp;get more done by vaguer thoughts that don’t condemn streetcars outright but rather make San Antonio seem like a very special case where they won’t work:</p>
<p>“San Antonio is special, and it deserves home-grown&nbsp;solutions. One size&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;fit all. I don’t know if you’ve checked the weather forecast this morning, but it’s safe to say&nbsp;I’m not in Oregon anymore&nbsp;[chuckles from the crowd]. San Antonio needs to build on home-grown&nbsp;success stories like the cutting edge&nbsp;Primo bus rapid transit system.”</p>
<p>I run into this all the time even in my daily life. I help my parents manage their money, and my dad will never ever believe that index funds do just as well as managed funds. I tried explaining this to him a couple of times, and he can’t get over the idea that a man who went to Harvard reading the Wall Street Journal will make lots of money with magical judgement calls. What my dad wants, fundamentally, is to be able to think about somebody smart fretting over his money. Since he wants this, I got him into some very low fee Vanguard funds.</p>
