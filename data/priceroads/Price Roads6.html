			<p>From Slate’s Moneybox blog, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/04/02/infrasturcture_privatization_leads_to_bad_prices.html">Infrastructure Pricing Shouldn’t Maximize Profits</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now in the real world, publicly owned transportation infrastructure is essentially never priced optimally as I outlined above. So it’s very possible that in practice some jurisdictions are reaping some gains by moving to privatization. But in a structural sense, privatizing your bridges is a step toward locking bad pricing policies in permanently.</p>

<p>Those of us in the pro-pricing camp need to be watchful of privatization deals that could ruin the pricing brand. We need public officials to strike a hard bargain.</p>

			<p>At <a href="http://www.thefreemanonline.org/headline/donald-shoup-takes-san-francisco/">The Freeman</a> online, Professor Sandy Ikeba of SUNY-Purchase muses on San Francisco’s demand-priced parking meters:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As I said before, to do market pricing correctly, well, you need markets. What the San Francisco approach does is to try to mimic what it is thought a private market would do. But the standard of “at least one empty parking spot” is arbitrary – like mandating that every ice-cream cone have two and only two scoops of ice cream. The Shoup-inspired San Francisco solution is I think a step in the right direction, but only a step.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Street parking is zero-priced because those streets, and the curbs and sidewalks that abut them, are not privately owned.</p>

<p>I wish libertarians would give more unqualified support for governments that practice road pricing and parking pricing (road pricing for stationary cars). I think Dr. Ikeda supports San Francisco’s plan, but it’s kinda buried. He obviously supports privatization, but privatization is not on the agenda in San Francisco, nor will it be. Elsewhere he criticizes Mayor Bloomberg’s congestion pricing plan as “intervention,” which from a libertarian has undertones of opposition:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Every so often during his tenure as mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg has tried to push through congestion pricing, in which drivers would have to pay to use city streets in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. That’s a popular solution to chronic overcrowding but, like drinking coffee to try to cure a hang over, it doesn’t really get to the heart of the matter. More intervention usually doesn’t solve the problems that were themselves the result of a prior intervention.</p>

<p>This is a problem with libertarians: you can’t figure out how they rank policies below their favorites and above their worst-case scenarios. For example, I know libertarians abhor Keynesian fiscal stabilization, and I know that thinking libertarians like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Selgin">George Selgin</a> want “free banking” to determine (or undertermine, as you will) macro-stabilization. But in-between it’s unclear what to do, which leads a wide berth for&nbsp;asinine&nbsp;gold fetishism/Internet-Austrianism/superstitious fear of “printing money.” That’s why a libertarian like Scott Sumner, whose NGDP-level-targeting strategy would neutralize the case for fiscal policy in its entirety by making the multiplier zero, gets angry comments from libertarians. On road pricing, this ambiguity leads grassroots liberty-lovers to organize against strategies that, while not fully free market solutions, at least embrace the price system and give drivers more choice. Other times I hear about people filing lawsuits against private utility companies for installing smart meters, in the interest of liberty. To be clear, I think the libertarian intelligentsia does have these policies ordered, but there always seems to be a vagueness in their advocacy I wish they would drop, even if it pissed off your run-of-the-mill Ron Paul/conspiracy theory libertarian.</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not a libertarian. I’m a registered Democrat, because social insurance is a success.</p>

			<p>The Atlantic Cities Blog asks <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2012/03/should-we-pay-people-drive-peak/1586/">‘Should We Pay People to Drive Off Peak</a>?’</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Congestion pricing is an economics-based approach to the traffic problem that focuses on punishing certain behaviors: in this case, driving during peak hours. But a good deal of psychological evidence suggests that rewards are often more effective than punishments at changing behavior.</p>

<p>This strategy is product of cognitive illusion. Because congestion pricing and off-peak payments accomplish the same goal, our minds pit them as alternatives to be traded off against one another. But congestion pricing is a revenue source, and off-peak payments are an expenditure. There is no trade-off. It’s like saying that reading is more effective than Doritos.</p>
<p>To be fair, the Netherlands carried out a field trial of this strategy and compared it favorably to a road pricing stated preference survey:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This time the researchers recruited nearly 350 people who commuted regularly to The Hague on the A12 roadway from Zoetermeer, a commuter city. The commuters were offered a daily reward (between 3 and 7 euros) if they didn’t drive the A12 between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m. and instead either drove at another time or commuted by another mode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With all that said, Tillema and colleagues found that about 37 percent of car trips were diverted from rush hour in the rewards scheme, compared to only about 15 percent estimated to change times in the pricing plan.</p>

<p>If the Dutch were only able to divert 15 percent of traffic with a pricing plan, then the price in their pricing plan was too low. &nbsp;Also, this system becomes complicated quickly. If it’s only for rush-hour commuters, how can you verify that someone would have gone to work at rush hour otherwise? It’s like paying out a ‘healthy eating’ subsidy to everyone who swears they would have otherwise eaten Moonpies for breakfast. Anyway, no actual cities are flush enough to do this. My home county recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/business/jefferson-county-ala-falls-off-the-bankruptcy-cliff.html?pagewanted=all">fell off a cliff according to the New York Times</a>. Actually, I just found an exception:</p>

<p>Good luck Dubai.</p>

			<p>Matt Yglesias makes a good point (<a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/housing/2012/03/mixed-politics-urbanism/1525/">link</a>)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When progressives, for example, see a fight pitting a neighborhood activist against rich developers, their instinct is to side with the activist, even if all the developer really wants to do is erect a building that will allow a lot more people to live or work or shop in their neighborhood…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the fact that houses and offices are built by rich businessmen shouldn’t distract people. The important issue is that American families need houses to live in. If space is scarce, then poor people won’t be able to afford homes and low-margin businesses and startups won’t stay in business.</p>

<p>I wonder what progressives will make of private corporations charging people to drive cars on major roads. A rich businessman is winning, but so are bus-riders and air-breathers. I’m not really excited about road privatization either, but for different reasons.</p>
<p>I just read The Rent is Too Damn High. It is way too short, and I was&nbsp;dissatisfied&nbsp;as a customer. The Great Stagnation is my reference point for ebooks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the road pricing movement and the housing deregulation movement go hand-in-hand both ideoogically and politically. They are brothers-in-arms for the unmitigated price system. And, more practically, I think it will be impossible to price entire highways as long as exurbs are the default option for lower-middle income people. Exurbs are waaaay cheaper. If we could build up cities and inner-ring suburbs more, then geographic equity would become divorced&nbsp;from income equity. It would seem as imaginary as it actually is.</p>

			<p>Apparently South Africa is going ahead with its road tolls despite huge opposition from the trade union COSATU. I am mainly interested in the types of arguments people make against road tolling. Here are some excerpts from COSATU’s manifesto (<a href="http://www.cosatu.org.za/show.php?ID=5918">link</a>)</p>
<p>First and foremost, the tolls will add to the burdens of the poor.</p>
<p>The tolls will put a direct burden on the poor of Gauteng and our country broadly, who will be forced to pay for travelling on the tolled roads.</p>
<p>Our second objection is that the tolls will perpetuate exclusion</p>
<p>The logic of those who say that the poor do not use our motorways, except by public transport, is that they should be permanently excluded from access to the best roads. They must find the potholed side-roads to get from A to B, while the rich glide along in their fancy cars.</p>
<p>Our third objection is that public transport is totally inadequate</p>
<p>We acknowledge that government has now exempted registered public transport vehicles from the tolls. However, the fact of the matter is that public transport remains woefully inadequate both in quality and in the numbers of people that it serves.</p>
<p>A third of our people use private cars to get to and from work. This is not a free choice. It is because our public transport system is expensive, unsafe, and unreliable.</p>
<p>Finally, the tolls represent a form of privatisation, which we have always been opposed to</p>
<p>COSATU has an unwavering record of being opposed to privatisation. The introduction of a tolling system that brings in the private sector to operate the tolled roads is, in our view, nothing else but privatisation.</p>
<p>With the exception of privatization, these are&nbsp;essentially&nbsp;the same lines of opposition to tolling in the United States: the welfare of the poor, inequality of access (different than welfare concerns), and lack of public transport options. &nbsp;This shows why congestion pricing has really only happened in societies that redistribute a lot of income and have good public transport. The exception, Singapore, has a unique political balance.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/opinion/keller-meet-sam-schwartz.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1">Meet Sam Schwartz</a>: Bill Keller, former editor of the NYTimes, endorses Gridlock Sam’s congestion pricing plan.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You do not have to be an engineer to appreciate the logic. The scheme puts the heaviest onus on the solo driver who has ready access to a train, and lowers the cost for drivers who have no alternative. Unlike earlier plans that amounted to a punishing tax on commuters from outlying communities, the Schwartz plan has more affluent neighborhoods (like the plusher parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens) pay a fair share. Though the main purpose is to underwrite public transport, the plan sets aside money to make the highways more bearable — in part so trucks will use them and avoid the populous business districts.</p>

			<p><a title="Washington Metro Turns Down Money" href="http://priceroads.com/2012/01/13/washington-metro-turns-down-money/">Back here</a> I commented on the sad end of the peak-of-the-peak fare on the DC Metro.</p>
<p>Now a reader has written into WaPost’s Dr. Gridlock with a nuanced support of congestion pricing. (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/should-metro-charge-congestion-fares/2012/02/28/gIQA3t2SpR_story.html">link</a>)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The goal should be congestion relief, not revenue. The current peak-of-peak fare was designed with revenue enhancement in mind. A true peak-of-peak system would focus much more narrowly. For example, no peak surcharge would apply for those traveling in a direction opposite the main flow of riders.</p>

<p>I agree that a good fare policy would&nbsp;discriminate&nbsp;on the basis of&nbsp;direction. But why shouldn’t revenue be one of the twin goals of congestion pricing? The DC Metro is running an enormous deficit and will have to increase fares 5% next year.</p>

			<p>Americans for Tax Reform believes that removing the tax credit for ethanol is a tax increase. Therefore, I think if Grover Norquist and ATR say something is not&nbsp;a tax then it’s fair to say it’s not a tax. And <a href="http://www.atr.org/atr-applauds-effort-find-other-methods-a1431#ixzz1nbI3QhdQ">what do you know</a>:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) offered support for H.R. 1767, the Freeing Alternatives for Speedy Transportation (FAST) Act yesterday. The legislation, introduced by Representative Mark Kennedy (R-MN) on April 11, 2003, repeals the outdated prohibition in order to permit expansion on congested interstate corridors paid for by user-fees.</p>
<p>“The plan creates a new revenue stream to fund new roads without increasing the federal gasoline tax,” said Grover Norquist, President of ATR…</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012. The influential group Stolen Lanes opposes &nbsp;HOT lanes projects around Atlanta. On their <a href="http://stolenlanes.org/">website </a>last month, Howard Rodgers claimed <a href="http://stolenlanes.org/2012/01/a-toll-is-a-tax.html">tolls are taxes</a>:</p>
<p>Taxes are used to support government operations, the tolls collected on Georgia roadways are supporting government agencies and operations. Demand your tax credit!</p>
<p>I <a href="http://stolenlanes.org/2012/01/a-toll-is-a-tax.html#comments">commented</a>:</p>
<p>Is a court fee a tax? Is the fee at a municipal parking deck a tax? What about a parking meter? Or the entrance fee to a state park? Or the royalties that oil companies pay to drill on government land? I suppose these are all taxes, since the money from these sources supports government operations.</p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<p>Yes these are actually ALL taxes, the proof is in the ability to use receipts from ALL of the above mentioned ideas by companies and corporations for tax purposes as business expenses. My annual state park pass is deductible, as are my parking fees when used for business expenses. Court fees are also deductible by businesses along with royalties (subsidies). Nice try. The idea that a toll is nothing more than a donation or bribe to use a public road is idiotic. Your linked website would indicate that you either work for the Govt or are a contracted employee of the Govt. and you have a vested interest in the toll (TAX) system.</p>
<p>Obviously Mr. Rodgers’ definition of a tax is more broad than anyone else’s. &nbsp;To be clear, he believes that a park pass is a tax. I wonder if he considers a bus pass to be a tax. In Mr. Rodgers’ neighborhood virtually all money that enters the account of a government agency is a form of taxation. I would assume that your electricity bill is a form of taxation if your power provider is publicly-owned, too.</p>
<p>Advocates of road pricing should do more to engage opponents philosophically. The logical extensions of anti-pricing arguments are easy to reach and obviously counter to American traditions of government. Road pricing is a tax because it pays for government? Then park passes are taxes. Road pricing is unfair because it lets rich people buy more of something? Then gasoline, bus and corn pricing is unfair.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I don’t work for the government. I’m a graduate student in England. However, I do have a vested interest in the “toll (TAX)” system, since I plan to work one day and would pay money to bypass traffic.</p>

			<p>Dr. Lisa Schweitzer replies to the pro-transit bloggers who disdain the house transportation bill (<a href="http://lisaschweitzer.com/2012/02/10/the-house-transport-bill-is-anti-federalist-not-anti-transit/">link</a>):</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The bill a does a bunch of really unfortunate things, but the one that has the average urbanist’s undies in a twist is that the bill cuts transit, walking, biking projects off from the Highway Trust Fund, to fend for themselves in the general budgetary process at the federal level.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What House Republicans are disputing in this Bill isn’t whether cities should have adorable little trolley trains and wonderful bikes lanes and capacious sidewalks. What they dispute: that the feds, and not cities themselves, should pay for them.</p>

<p>I want to highlight a political market failure that justifies&nbsp;federal spending on bikes+transit.</p>
<p>Voters exhibit Arthur Pigou’s defective telescopic faculty&nbsp;for local infrastructure. That is, because infrastructure last longer than each voter is likely to live in a single community, voters will stop investing in infrastructure well before the Net Social Benefits of marginal investment decline to zero.</p>
<p>Let’s say people will enjoy a bike path in Pittsburgh for 50 years. I’m uncertain I will live in Pittsburgh then. But somebody&nbsp;will live in Pittsburgh and receive the benefits of the bike path. Meanwhile, I will probably live somewhere in America&nbsp;and enjoy bike paths wherever that place may be.</p>
<p>We would all be made better off by collectively committing&nbsp;to build infrastructure in our communities. One way to commit is to invest in infrastructure at the federal level.</p>
<p>However, the pork politics and inefficiency wrought by spending other people’s money might outweigh this market failure. For example, Pittsburgh spent half a billion on a rail tunnel to the North Shore, even though we wouldn’t have bought that even if we all had to live in Pittsburgh for the rest of our lives (reverse Groundhog Day). Meanwhile, the bus system underwent massive cuts during the tunnel’s construction phase.</p>

			<p>From Bloomberg. Dr. Ed Glaeser, author of the excellent Triumph of the City (my review <a href="http://rustwire.com/2011/02/20/the-pros-and-cons-of-triumph-of-the-city/">here</a>), gives ways to improve transportation (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-14/spending-won-t-fix-what-ails-u-s-transport-commentary-by-edward-glaeser.html">link</a>):</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">IMPLEMENT CONGESTION PRICING: We should expect drivers to pay for more than just the physical costs of their travel. We should also expect them to pay for the congestion that they impose on other road users. If you have a scarce commodity, whether groceries or roads, and you insist on charging prices below market rates, the result will be long lines and stock outs, like those that bedeviled the Soviet Union decades ago. Yet U.S. roads are still running a Soviet-style transport policy, where we charge too little for valuable city streets. Traffic congestion is the urban equivalent of a stock out.</p>

<p>Well said. The common “unpriced roads are Soviet” argument is good marketing for the educated observers who guide policy. It ties congestion pricing to the consensus view, shared even by liberals, that the Soviet Union’s breadlines proved price controls fail outside of medicine.</p>
<p>Is road pricing is nearing escape velocity? That is, is it so nailed into conventional wisdom of wonks and bureaucrats to become a juggernaut…like free trade? Free trade is still unpopular, but among both liberal and conservative leaders it’s litmus test of seriousness and savvy. Consider what Lord Keynes said about Ricardo’s (false) iron laws:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The completeness of the Ricardian victory is something of a curiosity and a mystery. It must have been due to a complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was projected. That it reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect, added, I suppose, to its intellectual prestige. That its teaching, translated into practice, was austere and often unpalatable, lent it virtue. That it was adapted to carry a vast and consistent logical superstructure, gave it beauty. That it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress, and the attempt to change such things as likely on the whole to do more harm than good, commended it to authority.</p>

<p>Luckily, congestion pricing is good policy, unlike Ricardo’s theories. But the same forces–a logical superstructure, progress despite the existence of losers, the futility of most activism–make congestion pricing a perfect idea for what Paul Krugman likes to call the Very Serious People.</p>
