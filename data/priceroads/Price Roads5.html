			<p>Last week I emailed Nassim Taleb, the philosopher/trader/author of The Black Swan, to ask if he’d considered infrastructure. If you’re unfamiliar with Taleb’s work, he opposes forecasting, as typically understood. Instead he advocates people design systems to be “antifragile,” which is the subject of his forthcoming book and means something like “able to benefit&nbsp;from unpredictable volatility.” I emailed him because I can’t imagine an infrastructure policy without forecasting. Infrastructure is really expensive, so it only makes sense to build if the benefits accrue over decades. However, as Taleb points out in other fields, forecasts are not actually very accurate, even when you spend a lot of money on consultants. So what are we to do?</p>
<p>To my surprise, Taleb emailed me back <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pebbles.pdf">a link to a PDF</a> of a draft of a chapter of his new book. If you’re used to Strunk and White-style economy in prose I’ll warn you to focus on the ideas and ignore Taleb’s (intentionally ?) meandering style. Taleb emphasizes using stressors to make sure something is resilient; and I’ve wondered if he tests his work by including doses of insult, stereotyping, and health advice. Anyway, I don’t mean to praise with faint damning. An excerpt:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let us start as usual with a transportation problem, and generalize to other areas. Travelers (typically) do not like uncertainty —especially when they are on a set schedule. Why? There is a one way effect.<br>
I’ve taken the very same London-New York flight most of my life. The flight takes about 7 hours, the equivalent of a short book plus a brief polite chat with a neighbor and a meal with Port wine, stilton cheese and crackers. I recall a few&nbsp;instances in which I arrived early, about twenty minutes, no more. But there have been instances in which I got there more than two and three hours late, and, in at least one instance, it has taken me more than two days to reach my destination.&nbsp;Because travel time cannot be really negative, uncertainty tends to cause delays, making arrival time increase, almost never decrease. Or it makes arrival time just decrease by minutes, and increase by hours, an obvious asymmetry.<br>
Anything unexpected, any shock, any volatility is much more likely to extend the total flying time.</p>

<p>Later he makes the same point about large projects: they can take much more time than you expected but there is a limit on how much less, because they can’t take less than zero months. Does this lesson apply to demand?</p>
<p>Here he is on airport delays and capacity:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a hint to a central problem of the world today, that of the &nbsp;misunderstanding of nonlinear response by those involved in creating “efficiencies” and “optimization” of systems. For instance, European airports and railroads are stretched, seeming overly efficient. They operate at close to maximal capacity, with minimal redundancies and idle capacity, hence acceptable costs; but a small additional congestion, say 5% more planes in the sky owing to a tiny backlog can set chaos in airports and cause scenes of unhappy travelers camping on floors; their only solace the sight of some bearded fellow playing French folk songs on his guitar.</p>

<p>Although Taleb blames optimization, the troublesome tendency to go near to capacity is actually symptomatic of political pressure from carriers. Most economists and civil engineers would love to lower demand with pricing schemes, but pricing schemes are extremely unpopular. Airports slots are rationed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they were priced, then we would see some extra capacity and even an incentive to expand capacity as in US toll roads. This is related to the value of <a href="http://bca.transportationeconomics.org/benefits/travel-time-reliability">travel time reliability</a>. <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1736328">&nbsp;Here is</a> Dr. David Levinson on travel time reliability and HOT lanes in Minneapolis. Dr. Kenneth Small found that women value reliability twice as much as men on the SR91 Express Lanes, which is interesting.</p>
<p>As a back-of-the-envelope attempt, I would say applying antrifragile principles to transport means:</p>
<ul>
<li>More buses; fewer trains. Bus systems can be rerouted quickly.</li>
<li>Less worry over idle capacity in HOT lanes. The extra capacity is helpful during a major disruption.</li>
<li>More focus on extreme-but-possible scenarios like oil embargoes, war, and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles; less focus on the mean Value of Travel Time Savings (gulp! putting myself out of a job there.)</li>
<li>Denser cities, where people can walk around.</li>
<li>Continued emphasis on multi-modal systems, getting people familiar with several ways to move.</li>
<li>Wariness of <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/p3/index.htm">public-private partnerships</a> if governments assume the tail-risk of a private port/toll road/airport.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/science/experimental-campaigns-pay-drivers-to-avoid-rush-hour-traffic.html?_r=4&pagewanted=1&ref=science#comments">Incentives for Drivers Who Avoid Traffic Jams</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">London, Singapore, Stockholm and a few other cities around the world battle heavy traffic with a “congestion charge,” a stiff fee for driving in crowded areas at peak hours. But drivers generally hate the idea, and efforts to impose it in this country have failed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a title="Web site" href="http://www.stanford.edu/~balaji/">Balaji Prabhakar</a>, a professor of computer science at&nbsp;<a title="More articles about Stanford University" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/stanford_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Stanford University</a>, thinks he has a better way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So this spring, with a $3 million research grant from the federal Department of Transportation, Stanford deployed a new system designed by Dr. Prabhakar’s group. Called Capri, for&nbsp;<a title="Web site" href="https://stanfordcapri.org/welcomeinfo.php">Congestion and Parking Relief Incentives</a>, it allows people driving to the notoriously traffic-clogged campus to enter a daily lottery, with a chance to win up to an extra $50 in their paycheck, just by shifting their commute to off-peak times.</p>

<p>The article reports that the experiment is a success. I wish the best for lottery initiatives. However, I’m wary for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a lottery reliably cuts the peak-hour traffic enough to improve congestion, then after a while we will see some induced demand at the peak. The lottery will move some of the former peak-hour&nbsp;travellers&nbsp;to an earlier time, but the reduced congestion will shift some&nbsp;travellers&nbsp;into the peak.</li>
<li>The human mind is quick to categorize. In this case we have put “lottery payments” and “pricing” into a box labelled “congestion strategies.” We are prone to think they are competing with one another because they are both solutions to the same problem. In fact this intuition is entirely wrong. The policies are on opposite sides of the government’s balance sheet. Some of the critics in the NYTimes article say “That’s nice, but how do you pay for it?” That’s not the issue. The issue is that you can have as big a lottery system as you want without forgoing any ability to price the roads. It’s weird, because most solutions really do compete with one another. Spending on buses reduces a cities’ possible road upgrades. But there’s simply no trade-off here.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am hopeful about this program for one reason:</p>
<ol>
<li>This would might be very effective for senior citizens. They can alter their schedules more easily, and they love games of chance. Elderly people love bingo, lotteries and slot machines.</li>
</ol>

			<p><a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=237385">Alone in car? Pay tolls</a></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finance Minister AMA Muhith came up with an idea to ease the ever-deteriorating traffic congestion by introducing road pricing and taxing people into carpooling.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“In order to ease traffic congestion, sedan cars should not be allowed to ply the city roads unless three passengers travel together. Otherwise, extra toll should be imposed,” Muhith said.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I believe if we can properly enforce traffic rules and introduce road pricing, traffic congestion will not only be reduced, additional resources will be generated for road maintenance,” he said, adding that toll collection system should be introduced for roads and bridges wherever possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The idea came up during his budget speech in parliament yesterday while he was speaking about the communication sector.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Transport management expert Prof Shamsul Hoque of Buet’s civil engineering department termed the idea a good one but said it was not feasible in Bangladesh as cities of the country were unplanned and all modes of transport use the same piece of road in a chaotic manner.</p>

<p>I doubt that pricing will happen given the transaction costs and, as Prof Shamsul Hoque points out,&nbsp;chaotically&nbsp;diverse traffic stream in Bangladeshi cities. However, it says something about the ubiquity of the idea that this was proposed publicly.</p>
<p>I feel confident this idea was heard because Bangladesh is a Commonwealth nation. Even to people who despise the memory of the colonial era, what happens in the UK carries special salience; and that goes for the London congestion charge. During my time here, I’ve been amazed at the extent of intellectual exchange among Britain and her former colonies. The UK sends out experts to these countries, and their own people come in droves to earn degrees and conduct research. I think the Commonwealth is the most underrated (in America) international phenomenon.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Lee Munnich passes on news that famed transportation economist, Herb Mohring, passed away on June 4.</p>

<p>This is poignant because I am making an animation called “Tom Jones Explains the Mohring Effect.”</p>
<p>He researched road pricing, and the link above links to his work.</p>

			<p>A good Wall Street Journal article about Bus Rapid Transit in Delhi.&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/05/25/delhi-journal-the-big-bad-brt/tab/comments/">Urban Journal: Why Everyone Should Want Delhi’s BRT</a></p>
<p>Most importantly, this was good news:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Congestion Pricing is Coming to Delhi:&nbsp;In early 2010, under a Delhi High Court order, a Special Task Force was set up to study problems related to traffic congestion in the city. Among the subsequent proposals, congestion pricing was recommended for heavy vehicles entering Delhi and all vehicles entering certain congested parts of the city’s center and old quarter.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In December 2011, news broke that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi planned to charge car drivers 150 rupees ($2.70) and motorbike riders 50 rupees during the day (residents of congestion zones would be exempt in their area). Even though experts believe the plan would be difficult to implement in Delhi, it remains an option that may well be turned to in the future (or may manifest itself as an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/08/delhi-congestion-charge-ease-gridlock" target="_blank">increased tax on fuel in the city</a>).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Increase in Parking Fees:&nbsp;The Special Task Force also recommended a re-evaluation of parking practices in Delhi.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the Delhi Government is looking into it. In early May, Delhi’s Transport Department posted a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/c738d2804b2d39908224cf53a18bfeba/STF+PUBLIC+NOTICE.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&lmod=-568701045" target="_blank">public notice</a>&nbsp;inviting feedback on the proposal to increase parking fees. Existing fees range from about 10-20 rupees an hour, but the new proposal is to charge a fee of 50 rupees for the first three hours during peak times and 30 rupees for the first three off-peak hours. After this, every subsequent peak hour will cost 30 rupees, and every off-peak hour 20 rupees. The proposal also includes a monthly charge of 1,500 rupees for residents, who have been parking for free until now.</p>

<p>Delhi has air problems and terrible congestion, even though few of its trips are by car.</p>

			<p>Vancouver is ripe for cordon based congestion pricing, because it has few access points. It’s a sideways Manhattan, with fewer bridges:</p>
<p><br>
<a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left;" href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=vancouver+map&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Vancouver,+Greater+Vancouver+Regional+District,+British+Columbia,+Canada&gl=uk&t=m&ll=49.261083,-123.114166&spn=0.15684,0.291824&z=11&source=embed">View Larger Map</a></p>
<p>Traffic is sort of a big deal. In 2011, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/08/30/bc-vancouver-livability.html">traffic problems cost Vancouver</a> their “World’s Most Livable City” crown from The Economists Intelligence Unit:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Jon Copestake of the Economist Intelligence Unit told CBC News the ranking reflects what he calls “regional” traffic issues.</p>

<p>Can you really write “World’s Third Most Livable City” on your highway signs? Third Place is Second Loser. Now they’re trying to do something about it. This piece from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fraserinstitute.org/about-us/who-we-are/staff/senior-research-staff.aspx">Joel Wood</a>&nbsp;of the Fraser Institute, @ <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Congestion+pricing+needed/6677021/story.html">The Vancouver Sun</a>, is dripping with Canadian reasonableness:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To tackle [congestion], Metro Vancouver Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation last month hit on the one obvious solution that has worked elsewhere: a comprehensive system of bridge and road tolls during peak periods, also referred to as congestion pricing. Such a policy would raise revenues while reducing traffic congestion, resulting in shorter, more consistent commute times Unfortunately, Blair Lekstrom, B.C. minister of transportation and infra-structure, rejected the proposal, likely because aside from congestion pricing, it also included an increased gas tax, a vehicle registration fee, and a regional carbon tax to fund additional investments in public transit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But in rejecting the entire proposal, Lekstrom dismissed the best policy prescription for Metro Vancouver’s traffic and transit woes: congestion pricing.</p>

<p>Addendum: I’ve been informed that The Economist made an error in judging Vancouver’s traffic problems.</p>

			<p>From the Chicago Sun-Times (<a href="http://www.suntimes.com/12746292-761/could-drivers-be-able-to-pay-their-way-out-of-traffic-congestion.html">link</a>)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Drivers could be given the option of paying more for a less-congested commute as part of a plan to rebuild and widen I-90 from O’Hare to Rockford.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It’s called congestion pricing and it would give people the choice to pay a fee for a better commute.</p>

<p>Pricing would be part of a massive widening project, similar to the beltway HOT lanes in DC.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The goal is to link Rockford to O’Hare Airport with eight lanes from the Kennedy Expressway to Randall Road and six lanes from Randall Road to I-39.</p>

<p>The eight-lane portion would be 34.3 miles, and the 6-lane portion would be 37.9 miles. If Chicagoans can enjoy 140 new lane-miles without paying more taxes, it’s a pretty good deal–although it’s not stated explicitly that the new lanes will be entirely self-financed.</p>
<p>In other news, some of Europe is about to go broke. The last time that happened they sold off lots of state property–steel mills and airlines and such. I wonder if this time they’ll give up the roads and, if so, what mechanism they’ll use for the auction.</p>

			<h3>Baruch Feigenbaum at Reason Foundation (<a href="http://reason.org/blog/show/transportation-policymakers-need-to">link</a>):</h3>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Earlier this week I was at a congestion pricing workshop hosted by the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, and consulting firm ICF in Providence, Rhode Island. Four of these workshops have already been held around the country and although this workshop was intended primarily to attract participants from the New England states, participants came from as far away as California, Florida and Iowa. The workshop included Planners and Engineers from Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington D.C.</p>

<p>This is great. The whole intellectual apparatus of transportation policy, operating at local through national levels, is dead set on piece-meal congestion pricing.</p>
<p>In the social sciences, nothing happens as fast or as slow as you’d think. No one predicted the Arab Spring. The economic theory of regulation still can’t explain the wave of deregulation in the 1980′s. Imagine explaining the Tea Party to someone in 2006. I think there’s a good chance that the 10′s will be the decade of road pricing.</p>

			<p>Timothy Lee reflects on building restrictions in the Bay Area. This is close to my heart, because I’m going to get my PhD &nbsp;in Transportation Engineering at UC Berkeley in the fall and will be paying a lot of rent. (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/05/10/why-the-bay-area-should-have-11-million-residents-today/">link</a>)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Today, the Bay Area has about 7 million residents. In a free housing market, the population of the San Francisco Bay Area would have been growing rapidly over the last two decades. For example, between 1900 and 1920, the growth of the auto industry helped the population of the Detroit metro area nearly triple, from 540,000 people to 1.4 million people. If the San Francisco Bay Area had grown that fast since 1990, it would have about 16 million people today.</p>

<p>In the debate over liberalising cities, I notice a whole lot of commentors make a logical error.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">People in the Silicon Valley are drawn to the culture of the valley. It’s a culture of living and enjoying the non-urban world around them. 365 days a year there is something to do and see here and it goes far beyond shopping and museums. Mix in another 4 million people and what makes this valley great would disappear or at least get crowded out.</p>

<p>The commentor is basically saying that, if more people were able to live in Silicon Valley, then people wouldn’t want to live in Silicon Valley. That reminds me of the Yogi Berra quote “Nobody goes there; it’s too crowded.” The reason that the Yogi Berra quote is funny is that it contains a fallacy. It’s wrong. What’s wrong about it is that what’s true of an individual–not wanting to go to a crowded place–is impossible to be true of society generally. It’s kind of like how, when you learn calculus, it’s mindboggling that the y*dx’s are individually negligible but somehow add up to big numbers.</p>
<p>This fallacy is really common. I hear all the time that, if cities had congestion pricing, then people won’t be able to get to work/businesses will move out. But if that were true, then the congestion price would be zero.</p>
<p>I don’t actually know very much about why cities restrict development, but I do know this is a bad argument.</p>

											<a href="http://priceroads.com/2012/05/09/transactions-transport/">800px-Sortie_de_l'opéra_en_l'an_2000-2</a>
				            
			<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/technology/amtrak-to-use-iphones-to-streamline-service.html?_r=2">New York Times</a>:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With the new system, passengers will be able to print tickets or load a special bar code on their smartphone screens for conductors to scan, and conductors will be able to keep track of passengers on board, Amtrak said.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“You don’t even need to print the document and bring it with you,” said Matt Hardison, chief of sales distribution at Amtrak, who helped plan the iPhone program. “We’ve made a number of important improvements for both our customers and Amtrak, all in one fell swoop.”</p>

<p>New technology cuts transaction costs. Easy transactions help organized firms to compete with self-sufficiency. That is, it lets The Market compete with Autarky. Transportation has more autarky than any industry besides housekeeping, but technology is changing all that.&nbsp;ZipCar allows people to pool auto capacity instead of individually buying cars. &nbsp;RFID, electronic banking, and plate-reading cameras allow governments to turn road capacity into a saleable commodity. JustEat makes it easy to get free delivery.</p>
<p>Easy transaction costs also allow small ‘firms’ to compete with large ones. Recently in Minneapolis I stayed in a dude’s room for $26/night instead of a hotel for $40, thanks to AirBnB. Craigslist let individuals kill the newspaper classifieds.</p>
<p>As to mass transit like AmTrak, it’s unclear how things average out. iPhone payment helps trains compete with autarky (people driving between cities alone). But a kind of iPhone payment (showing the driver your confirmation email) also helps competitor Megabus pickup people at the curb. And online booking faciliatates&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_management">yield management</a>, which enables more frequent, more customized services on a larger bus network. Eventually, iPhone payment between individuals will make it really easy to carpool.</p>
<p>My prediction for the future is that most rail firms, intercity and intracity, are going to die. Wireless payment only speeds up buses (what train is slowed down by people paying?). GoogleTransit is way more useful for buses than for trains (who can’t figure out where a subway goes?). Road pricing clears the way for buses to go faster. In the 20-year long run, autonomous vehicles will dispense with the unions, mandatory breaks, and minimum sizes that hinder bus service. Buses are more labor-intensive than trains but less land-intensive. Thus, every single trend is favoring buses more than trains.</p>
<p>To go a little sci-fi, in the future we will have ‘buses’ of varied sizes (some being merely cars) running exactly at capacity over unintuitive-but-efficient spiderweb networks with unintuitive-but-efficient schedules. In some cases, regular headways and circular routes represent efficiency bowing to memorability. But the&nbsp;incomprehensibility&nbsp;of a system designed by operations researchers won’t matter in the future, since we’ll be guided by smart phones that tell us where to go at what time. Stops will be infrequent and will take place quickly, especially once we have specialy-equipped buses for the handicapped and elderly.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that this high-accessibility system will enable a much higher labor-force participation rate. If you think of a day’s work as a production function, there is a high fixed cost to arriving and leaving work. For workers with low productivity (uneducated, low IQ, lazy, handicapped, recent immigrants or elderly), this makes it not worthwhile to even make it into the office/factory/housecleaning job. &nbsp;But in the future I have outlined, accessibility is so high that everyone will be able to get everywhere; and low-productivity workers will be able to trade their abundant time for money with unprecedented ease.</p>
