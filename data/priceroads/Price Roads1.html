			<p>Over at National Review, Reihan Salam points out that college attendance explains an&nbsp;under-appreciated&nbsp;share of falling labor force participation for young people (<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/347480/americas-dismal-youth-nonemployment-rate">link</a>):</p>
<p>In recent years, the percentage increase in the number of students age 25 and over has been larger than the percentage increase in the number of younger students, and this pattern is expected to continue.&nbsp;Between 2000 and 2010, the enrollment of students under age 25 increased by 34 percent. Enrollment of students 25 and over rose 42 percent during the same period.</p>
<p>I am nonemployed. In fact I am 26.5 and have only participated 18 months in the full-time labor force, 5 months of which I was self-employed doing freelance motion graphics. I didn’t even work summers during college. Instead I made a documentary (<a href="http://www.aptv.org/videoroom/viewprogram.asp?FileID=900">It’s a Thick Book</a>) and went all around South America.</p>
<p>(Here I am about to do some economics with no data at all.)&nbsp;I believe this tendency among young people is partly a rational response to life-cycle income inequality. Scott Sumner gives an example of what I mean (<a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=7215">link</a>)</p>
<p>I dragged out my annual Social Security data that I get in the mail, and it shows how much I earned during each year.&nbsp; I tried to do a rough adjustment for&nbsp;cost of living changes,&nbsp;to make things fairer (otherwise my income looks extremely unequal.)&nbsp; I am pretty sure my five income “quintiles” are roughly as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; 3%, 13%, 22%, 27%, and 35%.&nbsp; In other words during my worst 7 years I made 3% of my total real lifetime income, and during my best 5 years about 35%.</p>
<p>You might divide jobs into two categories. In ‘up-through-the-ranks’ jobs, you are rewarded for years of service. In ‘leverage’ jobs, you are either rewarded for having unusual skills or arbitrage. You could call ‘leverage’ jobs ‘meritocratic’ but that is value-laden and I’d argue clearly wrong. For example, Hilary Duff was paid $100,000 to&nbsp;not&nbsp;star in&nbsp;Bonnie and Clyde&nbsp;after she got pregnant (<a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Hilary-Duff-Paid-100-000-To-Walk-Away-From-Bonnie-And-Clyde-Remake-26482.html">link</a>). She was paid $100,000 not to work.</p>
<p>In an ‘up-through-the-ranks’ job, there is a high opportunity cost to delaying full participation. I recently advised my Teamster cousin, who was born 30 days after me and has never not worked at least 40-hour weeks, on his best retirement option. The defined-benefit options all paid in direct proportion to years-of-service. &nbsp;Further, he gets automatic raises, and is guaranteed to get promoted. He will be a millionaire if he just saves wisely and sticks with his job.</p>
<p>In a ‘leverage’ job, most of your lifetime earnings will happen quickly and without much regard for your past employment.There is a low opportunity cost to forgoing the irrelevant beginning of your working life. On the contrary, it makes sense to spend those years signaling that you are worthy of a leverage job, which college and grad school and internships and other signaling measures accomplish sometimes.</p>
<p>For an good example of a non-college option, I’ll use my roommate, a computer programmer. He works part-time teaching JavaScript–earning enough to get by–and spends the rest of his time on open-source. Recruiters are always leaving messages on his cell phone, because a recruiter can be paid $10k for landing him, but the opportunity cost of a year spent working full-time is too large…he could become famous enough in the open-source community to get a huge freelance salary or join a promising startup. And since the companies don’t have defined pension plans, automatic promotions or raises, his foregone salary doesn’t handicap his lifetime consumption very much. Finally, the leverage he attains from open-source (code skill + a signal of creativity) has a sky-high&nbsp;option value because it is&nbsp;universal:&nbsp;all tech firms will yield to this leverage. The leverage he would obtain over years of working at a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;tech firm would be specific to his knowledge of that firm, and other firms would have no use for it should the firm dwindle.</p>
<p>My impression is that ‘up-through-the-ranks’ jobs are dwindling and leverage jobs are propagating. The opportunity cost of grad school and other signaling/skill-enhancement opportunities&nbsp;are therefore falling for those able enough to seize its signals.</p>
<p>However, it is also important to note how much of increased college attendance is founded on delusion. Alex Tabarrok (<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/11/college-has-been-oversold.html">link</a>):</p>
<p>The chart at right shows the number of bachelor’s degrees in various fields today and 25 years ago. STEM fields are flat (declining for natives) while the visual and performing arts, psychology, and communication and journalism (!) are way up.</p>
<p>The MA Journalism complex is a perfect example of an industry founded on delusion. When I attended the Institute for Humane Studies Journalism camp in 2009, the real journalists’ main goal seemed to be to convince us not to get one. The J.D. and part-time MBA (especially the ones with ‘leadership’ in the degree titles) complexes seem from afar to be similar delusionocracies. A lot of the salespeople at the steel newspaper where I used to work once worked for the Art Institutes’ parent company, where they made money not scamming but deluding veterans, which has been documented (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-23/veterans-failing-to-learn-show-hazards-of-for-profit-schools-under-gi-bill.html">link</a>).</p>

			<p>Matt Yglesias on the Oregon Medicaid expansion (<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/05/06/conservatives_medicaid_and_the_poor_do_they_care_at_all.html">link</a>):</p>
<p>A lottery is great from the viewpoint of experiment design, but the sample size here was tragically small.</p>
<p>They&nbsp;interviewed&nbsp;over 6,000 people in the treatment group and over 5,000 in the control. What does Matt Yglesias consider a medium sample? A large sample? 90,000 people applied for the lottery, so we have a sample equal to about 1/8th of the population. I’m supposing he means it was tragically small because more people should have received Medicaid. But that’s assuming the gains that haven’t materialized.</p>
<p>I am reading&nbsp;The Signal and the Noise right now. I think Nate Silver will probably be the best public intellectual of the&nbsp;millennial&nbsp;generation, because he is a talker and&nbsp;a do-er, a techie and&nbsp;a writer. Anyway, it’s true that the Oregon Medicaid study does not prove there are no gains from Medicaid expansion. But if your prior was a high probability of large health gains, then the two-year results–while not definitive–should cause you to revise your prior downward, to say, “There is a smaller chance than I expected that Medicaid expansion will make people a lot healthier.” Instead of revising their priors, we have seen supporters revise their bets, saying, “It resulted in large mental health gains!” Virtually no supporter of Medicaid expansion has ever said, ex ante, “We’ve got to expand Medicaid to reduce depression!” Why not? Because depression care is a tiny fraction of Medicaid spending, and if reducing depression were your goal then for the price of Medicaid expansion you could design a more targeted program to reduce depression…unless, of course, you think the depression gains were achieved solely because of the financial cushion that Medicaid provides, in which case you’re admitting that medical science played virtually no role in the program’s success. You’d be saying that, for the same level of government expenditure, an expansion of fire, flood, disability, unemployment and car insurance would have similar effects on depression.</p>
<p>Again, I’m floored no one has pointed out the drop in depression was&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;without any change in the rate of prescription medication. It is at least worth looking into how they achieved such large gains without medicine. Prescription&nbsp;antidepressants&nbsp;cost money and have side effects, such as loss of sexual appetite and suicidal thoughts, so if we can achieve large gains without&nbsp;increasing the&nbsp;prevalence&nbsp;of antidepressants, then, unless there is something magically optimal about the level of prescription in the status quo, the chances are we can improve mental health by decreasing the rate of prescription somewhat and substituting more of whatever it was that improved outcomes in Oregon. Please note I’m not some scientologist or someone suspicious of western medicine.&nbsp;Skepticism&nbsp;about the optimality of the current margin is exactly in line with the evidence here.</p>

			<p>Everyone is debating what the Oregon Health Study means for Medicaid. I am interested in what this study means for medicine. The run down of the study, coauthored by econometrics rock star Amy Finkelstein:</p>
<p>This randomized, controlled study showed that Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first 2 years, but it did increase use of health care services, raise rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and reduce financial strain. (<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1212321">New England Journal of Medicine</a>)</p>
<p>Among the four ‘results’, only one is a change in health: the drop in depression.&nbsp;The prior incidence of depression was 30%, which seems high but isn’t when you consider that Oregon is among the most depressed states (<a href="http://www.nmha.org/go/state-ranking">link</a>), and that poor people are understandably more depressed, and that depression makes it hard to earn money. But anyway, look under the hood:</p>
<p>There was no statistically significant increase in the use of medication for depression, but Medicaid increased the probability of being diagnosed with depression after the lottery</p>
<p>If no medication was dispensed, how did the depression fall? According to this article in the Post (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/18/can-oregon-save-american-health-care/">link</a>), you could get all kinds of counseling and attention:</p>
<p>Doctors had prescribed her 28 medications. Her social anxiety would get so bad that, sometimes, she rubbed her hands raw. By the time Whitaker got to Prineville to live with her cousin, she had given up on the health-care system.</p>
<p>At Mosaic Medical, Whitaker received care for her diabetes and blood pressure. She also began seeing the clinic’s behavioral health specialist every week, who helped tend to her anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Community health workers aided in other ways. They helped to ease her social anxiety by attending bingo night together. When Whitaker expressed an interest in moving out of her cousin’s house, Martinez helped her find an apartment.</p>
<p>“They have been the most moral support I’ve ever had in my life,” Whitaker said. “They cared, and that made me want to care. Little by little, when things got too frustrating in life, I’d see one of them. They changed my whole life.”</p>
<p>More than a judgement on Medicaid, this study is hugely damning for the practice of medicine. The government spent a lot of money giving people health care, and the only thing to show for it was 900 fewer depressed people (9% * 10,000 enrollees). Moreover, 0% of the gains are attributable to medication, and from the passage above appear to have not even been attributable to psychiatrists. This begs the question: at the margin, do we need more&nbsp;health care&nbsp;or more social workers?</p>
<p>The depression results are important, because they are what you might call the ‘residual of the argument.’ Amy Finkelstein said,</p>
<p>“There was this view that Medicaid coverage would not do much for the low-income uninsured, either because they had access to charity care or because Medicaid is not good insurance,” said Amy Finkelstein of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This rejects that notion entirely.”</p>
<p>This is moot. Anyone who was skeptical of Medicaid was skeptical that it improved health. No one was skeptical that Medicaid&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;sent checks to doctors, which is the essence of the claimed benefit of decreased financial hardship.</p>
<p>Consider that flood insurance is&nbsp;subsidized&nbsp;on the basis of helping people hurt by floods. The debate centers on whether this is a worthy expense.&nbsp;No one ever claims that flood insurance reduces flooding.&nbsp;But advocates of health insurance expansion always claim it will make people healthier. So, removing the evidence on things no one was even debating, depression results are the argument’s residual.</p>
<p>People will say that the increased use of medicine will show up later in mortality rates. It’s a long term thing. But none of the short term indicators of long-term distress improved. So either cholesterol and blood sugar and other measurements are not predictive, or the treatments in vogue today don’t change mortality in the long-run. Whether on the testing side or the preventative health side, a lot of money is blowing out the window.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;<a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html">the revolution two years ago</a>, working-class residents of that vast informal neighborhood, tired of having no direct access to the 45-mile-long Ring Road, took matters into their own hands. In the absence of functioning government, they built ramps from dirt, sand and trash. Then they invited the police to open a kiosk at the interchange.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if people start charging tolls to pay for these little&nbsp;improvements.</p>

			<p>“When the time is ripe for certain things, they appear at different places in the manner of violets coming to light in early spring.”</p>
<p>—&nbsp;<a title="Farkas Bolyai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkas_Bolyai">Farkas Bolyai</a>, to his son&nbsp;<a title="János Bolyai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai">Janos</a>, urging him to claim the invention of&nbsp;<a title="Non-Euclidean geometry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry">non-Euclidean geometry</a>&nbsp;without delay.<br>
Quoted in Li &amp; Vitanyi,&nbsp;<i>An introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications</i>, 1st ed., p. 83.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a title="an easier agenda" href="http://priceroads.com/2013/04/21/an-easier-agenda/">Sunday </a>I said the GOP should neglect the justice of top marginal tax rates and instead lay claim to the supply-side economics of the middle class. On Monday Bryan Caplan urged his corps of free-market economists to do&nbsp;something&nbsp;similar (<a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/04/the_grave_evil.html">link</a>). The post is probably going to be a classic, brimming with Caplan’s characteristic iconoclasm.</p>
<p>Instead of downplaying the grave evil of unemployment, we free-market economists should urge governments to redouble their efforts to fight it. How can we do so and remain free-market economists? First and foremost, by emphasizing the obvious: Every government imposes a vast array of employment-destroying regulations.</p>
<p>I want to draw a contrast between what I proposed, which I think is a viable Republican agenda, and Caplan’s proposed assault on government barriers to employment. I emphasized the supply side&nbsp;of middle class labor: pro-accessibility policies (eliminating bottlenecks and allowing a dense built environment) that make market production more attractive than household production, payroll tax cuts that lower worker’s own reservation wages, and reforming disability programs that actively discourage work. Although innovative among free-marketeers in that he takes nominal wage rigidity seriously, Caplan is still just thinking about hiring costs.</p>
<p>The real nut, though, is Caplan’s point about ideology. I’ll paraphrase:&nbsp;today’s environment determines which arguments are intuitive and thus the policies of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Free-market economists should be especially dismayed by the cultural and political effects of unemployment.&nbsp; When every able-bodied worker can easily find a place to sell his skills, the economy reveals a clear connection between moral desert and practical success [...] Once people lose their confidence that every able-bodied person can easily take care of himself, this individualist ethos withers – and the welfare state grows like a weed.</p>
<p>Right on! And he correctly identifies&nbsp;which&nbsp;awful policy is responsible: tight money.</p>
<p>Imagine how much statist legislation could have been averted if the world’s central banks had kept NGDP on a steady course from 2008 to the present.</p>
<p>If there had not been a great Recession, it would have been far, far easier to argue for congestion pricing. When millions of Americans fell close to the margin of poverty, every marginal slice of income taken by tolls meant a scary step closer to the line of ‘not making it,’ and, for better or for worse, there are no food stamps for household transportation budges.</p>
<p>Alex Tabarokk says steady NGDP is why Australia has maintained the least intuitive market policies (<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/03/australia-notes.html">evidence</a>).&nbsp;Sometimes it’s sobering to recall that, for all the cool work we are doing in transportation, it is nibbling around the edges compared to what better monetary policy would accomplish. And yet, nothing I’ve read by Scott Sumner suggests that the actual&nbsp;research agenda&nbsp;of modern macro is at all that enlightening. All of the important truths are decades old, and the relevant mission of macroeconomists is correcting their rock stars’ cruel heterodoxy (<a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=5924">link</a>). If someone made an animation explaining MV = PY, countering the folk-Austrian mind-filth smeared all over the Internet (like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWH5TlbloU">garbage </a>that Ezra Pound would have watched on repeat in his asylum), he or she’d be more important to policy than 99% of hard-won macro theses.</p>
<p>This concludes my blogging for a while. Finals are coming, and I’ve got to publish.</p>

			<p>Milo Lehe: (named for Milo’s Sweet Tea)<br>
Hey grandpa, I just saw the 50th season of Mad Men, Mad Men: 2013. Did you really drive your own cars around?</p>
<p>Lewis Lehe:<br>
Boy did we! I was a professional race car driver actually.</p>
<p>Milo Lehe:<br>
Well, there must’ve been a lot of barriers between lanes.</p>
<p>LL:<br>
Nope! Sometimes you’d be going forty, and someone else’d be going forty in the opposite direction about six feet away in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>ML:<br>
What if your wrist or your foot slipped a litle bit?</p>
<p>LL:<br>
Sometimes you’d hit a school bus. Other times you’d just go off a bridge or a cliff or something.</p>
<p>ML:<br>
Woah! Back up! You’re telling me people died right in the road?</p>
<p>LL:<br>
It was like a serial killer attacked every city every day. And if someone in your high school got killed, the school had a Power Point slideshow of their class pictures, and everyone would cry, even if the guy was drunk as Christopher Hitchens on Guy Fawke’s Day and doing donuts in a VA Hospital parking lot when he went out.</p>
<p>ML:<br>
Wait a minute, it was legal to drive drunk?</p>
<p>LL:<br>
No! But…there were parking lots at bars. We knew what was going on. And there was this one actress named Lindsay Lohan…she was always drunk driving around so they…now I’m getting mixed up…so Giggle made her a special white Volkswagen bug that drove itself around, and that was the first driverless car. And it could talk! It was called Knight Rider. [nods off]</p>
<p>ML:<br>
Mom, can we put grandpa in the back seat next time? He’s drooling on the emergency wheel.</p>
<p>Jemima Lehe:<br>
Have some respect. He’s 120 years old and has ten master’s degrees.</p>

			<p>Fosgerau and Small (2012). <a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~ksmall/EndogenSchedPrefs.pdf">Endogenous scheduling preferences and congestion</a>.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>The authors look under the hood of the piecewise schedule delay function, which values each minute of earliness at one price and each minute of lateness at another. In a nutshell: for the morning commute, being at home before work is more enjoyable when your family is there, and you’re more productive at work when your coworkers are there. Therefore, if you get to work earlier than people typically do you’ll be giving up time when your whole family is at home in exchange for time when few people are at work…a lousy trade-off. Hence people tend to all want to be at home or work simultaneously, but the system can only switch over everyone from home to work with a queue. What’s the implication for tolling?<i><br>
</i></p>
<p>A naïve Vickrey-like analyst — observing&nbsp;one equilibrium and assuming scheduling preferences to be exogenously given —&nbsp;would ﬁnd that to be in accordance with his model. But because he ignores the&nbsp;positive temporal agglomeration externalities associated with being at home or at&nbsp;work, this analyst will underestimate the beneﬁts of a toll that reduces queueing&nbsp;during the commute and will make potentially very large errors in predicting the&nbsp;effect of policies such as capacity expansion and tolling. For some parameter sets,&nbsp;such an analyst would apply a toll schedule and/or aim for a departure pattern&nbsp;that is quite far removed from the optimal one.</p>
<p>Translation:&nbsp;Thinking about how people work and play together means tolling is more beneficial than we thought. Why? Let’s I spend one hour per day waiting at an off-ramp downtown. Bam! You kill the queue with a toll. Now I spend that hour at home or work, where other people reap the advantages&nbsp;of my presence. And I reap the advantages of other people’s extra time at home or work. A good deal all around.</p>
<p>What does this mean for winning arguments? A layman always doubts a high-income person’s value of time is truly higher, because it takes training for someone to accept willingness-to-pay as a measure of benefit, and because most people don’t think of a high wage worker as selling their labor in a competetive market place where the wage is commensurate to the value. Most people, focused on private gains, think of a high wage worker as someone who has ‘worked their way up.’ Maybe it’s easier to accept, though, that lower-level workers need their boss in the office to be productive, and it hurts them when he’s tied up in traffic.</p>

			<p>(a post only marginally about transportation)</p>
<p>What is the Republican Party’s focus? Just ask, “Which causes capture the marginal returns on the party’s investments of political capital?” The GOP has often gambled political capital on uncertain drives for policies that help rich people, like Social Security privatization, while ignoring bets that would shrink government but don’t help rich people, like easing occupational licensing.</p>
<p>What would be an easier, yet distinctly conservative, agenda for the party?</p>
<p>Matt Yglesias highlights one alternative (<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/03/conservatism_for_the_working_class_lower_taxes_and_fewer_services.html">link</a>):</p>
<div>
<p>But this debate leaves off the table a third option that ought to be considered more frequently in America—cut spending in order to cut taxes on the masses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Like maybe instead of subsidized health insurance premiums and college tuition we should give people money. Money can be used to pay college tuition. But it can also be used to pay for a vacation. Colleges would have to make the case that their educational offerings are more valuable than a great vacation. Conservatives, more broadly, could challenge liberals to a real debate about the value proposition of government services.</p>
</div>
<p>I agree, but here Matt only talks about the composition of the pie, not its size. I’d go further: Republicans should revel in the supply side economics of the middle class. Middle class labor force participation rates are falling, especially for young people and working-class males.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To date, both Republicans and Democrats have advertised strictly&nbsp;demand side solutions. While Democrats&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;demand more government hiring (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/opinion/brooks-the-progressive-shift.html">David Brooks opines</a>) and Republicans demand tax cuts for ‘job creators,’ both sides have essentially taken the supply of middle class workers for granted. Republicans have completely forgotten the Reagan-era intellectual&nbsp;vocabulary of elastic labor supply (when top marginal tax rates reached the 70%’s) but preserved the concern for rich people’s well-being.</p>
<p>And in a perverse Telephone Game played over decades, this heuristic of asking “What’s in it for the rich?” has led the party to seek tax increases on the middle class. That’s right,&nbsp;the party of supply side economics wants to&nbsp;raise&nbsp;taxes on the portion of the labor force whose supply is&nbsp;shrinking&nbsp;and&nbsp;cut&nbsp;taxes&nbsp;on that portion composed of workaholics.&nbsp;Mitt Romney complained about the 47 percent. Paul Ryan’s budget plan includes big tax increases on the middle class. &nbsp;Even Louisiana’s&nbsp;Rhode Scholar Governor Bobby Jindal has&nbsp;devastated&nbsp;his approval ratings for a charge at the windmill of raising sales taxes for the benefit of ‘job creators’ in a state famous for poverty and homicide, and his doomed crusade was not a&nbsp;cautionary&nbsp;tale but rather an inspiration to a whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children" s_crusade"="">Children’s Crusade</a> of suicidal Republican state leaders (<a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2013/04/18/4190126/brownbacks-fight-for-sales-tax.html">evidence</a>).</p>
<p>This agenda makes sense if you’re running a Randian social justice movement to unburden an overworked elite and punish the free-loading masses, but it just has nothing to do with the size of the economic pie, the size of government, utility, or supply side economics. Some Republicans might find it&nbsp;sobering&nbsp;to contemplate the degree of our degeneracy, but Americans simply do not find the question of whether top rates reach 39.6% or 35% to be the litmus test of the just society. It chills the blood.</p>

<p>What policies could Republicans champion to raise labor force participation?&nbsp;A bunch of&nbsp;nectarines&nbsp;sagging about a foot off the ground:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payroll tax cuts. If the return on middle class labor rises we will see middle class people supply more labor. Ross Douthat (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/opinion/sunday/douthat-our-enemy-the-payroll-tax.html?_r=0">link</a>): “In an era of mass unemployment, mediocre wage growth and weak mobility from the bottom of the income ladder, it makes no sense to finance our retirement system with a tax that falls directly on wages and hiring and imposes particular burdens on small business and the working class.” Last year Republicans did exactly the opposite, using payroll tax extensions as a hostage (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/us/politics/house-republicans-consider-extending-payroll-tax-cut-alone.html">link</a>).</li>
<li>Reorient infrastructure spending toward accessibility and away from geographic equity and awesomness, under the advertised logic that easier access to jobs will draw marginals into the labor force. Reihan Salam at National Review (<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/345094/when-thinking-about-infrastructure-focus-accessibility-reihan-salam">link</a>): “My sense is that the best way to increase accessibility is to focus on implementing peak road-user fees and using the resulting revenue stream to carefully add capacity at bottlenecks, and also to ease local land use regulations that have proven a barrier to increased density in high-productivity regions.”</li>
<li>Reorient secondary education toward apprenticeships, which means realism about the utility of lofty academics for many, perhaps the majority, of low-income pupils. More shop class will not cut it. Ed Luce in FT (<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/04/apprenticeships-need-more-respect.html">MR link</a>): “Fifteen per cent of taxi drivers in the US have a degree, up from 1 per cent in 1970. Likewise, 25 per cent of sales clerks are graduates, against 5 per cent in 1970. An astonishing 5 per cent of janitors now have a bachelor’s degree…Germany channels roughly half of all high-school students into the vocational education stream from the age of 16….More than 40 per cent of Germans become apprentices. Only 0.3 per cent of the US labour force does so.”</li>
<li>Accelerate the regulatory&nbsp;accommodation&nbsp;of of autonomous vehicles, which will will open up lots of part-time employment to disabled and elderly people.</li>
<li>Reduce occupational licensing. &nbsp;Only hardcore libertarians (<a href="https://www.ij.org/license-to-work-release-5-8-12">Institute for Justice</a>) have so much as mentioned occupation licensing, which is a literal prohibition on working, and none of the legislatures that turned solid red in the last cycle have lifted a finger to solve the problem.&nbsp;In an&nbsp;under-reported&nbsp;story, it was&nbsp;absurd&nbsp;licensing that kicked off the Tunisian Revolution (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_revolution#Sidi_Bouzid_and_Mohamed_Bouazizi">link</a>) and continues to be immolatory problem in that country (<a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/sana-ajmi/young-tunisian-cigarette-vendor-dies-of-self-immolation">link</a>), and Egypt’s unrest is largely due to an economy strangled by a military mafia monopoly (<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_09/b4217012945891.htm">link</a>).</li>
<li>Stricter requirements for disability insurance. &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/trends-with-benefits">This American Life</a>&nbsp;on the massive expansion of disability cases.)</li>
<li>Reign in the power of local governments to exclude new residents, just as Republicans have reigned in their powers to raise taxes. Many local regulations on building housing are immigration policies under a boring name, and like any immigration policies they keep people from being matched with great jobs. They could say, “Cities are treating working Americans like illegals!”</li>
</ul>

			<p>The New York Times lofts one to economists everywhere looking for teachable moments. I like that they specifically reference tolls:</p>
<p>Supreme Court Spectator Line Acts as a Toll Booth (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/supreme-court-spectator-line-acts-as-a-toll-booth.html?hp&_r=0">link</a>)</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">Professor Carpenter’s first surprise on that cold night was that most of the people in front of him in line were not waiting to get in. They were “line standers” who had been paid to hold places for others.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">“Many of them seemed to be homeless or very poor,” Professor Carpenter said. “It seemed very shady to me.”</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">The going rate, he learned, was about $50 an hour, some of which went to a company that had made the arrangements. Such place holding is common at Congressional hearings and is&nbsp;<a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/days-early-a-line-forms-at-the-supreme-court/">on the rise at the Supreme Court</a>, where seats for last month’s arguments<a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/news/2013/03/supreme-court-gay-marriage-tickets-cost-time-money">went for as much as $6,000</a>.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">Obviously this is a good way for homeless people to make money and productive people to save time for use on work and family life.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody"><a href="http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/faculty/michael-sandel">Michael J. Sandel</a>, a political philosopher at Harvard, said the phenomenon was disturbing.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">“Allowing line-standing companies and scalpers to sell seats in the Supreme Court is yet another instance of letting money dominate democracy,” he said. “It’s at odds with equal access and undermines the dignity of the court.”</p>

<p>I’m not sure how it’s at odds with equal access. My father has severe varicose veins all through his legs and can’t stand up very long without them swelling with blood unto intense soreness. My mother and I, and a large number of Jews, have the opposite problem: severe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raynaud" s_phenomenon"="">Raynaud’s Condition</a>. The vessels in our extremities contract under pretty slight cold and leave unbearable stinging. It would be impossible for anyone in my family to hear a Supreme Court argument in the winter except for my robust brother. It would definitely increase access if I could pay my brother to stand in line for me. And if I could pay my brother, could I pay a half-brother? What about a step-brother? What about a good friend? What about a casual acquaintance? What about a stranger?</p>
<p>You’d think the problem could be solved by creating heated&nbsp;queuing&nbsp;areas with chairs. But this will increase demand, and there will be lines for the standing areas. You’d think the problem could be solved by creating a lottery system. But people could sell their lottery tickets in a grey market. It is an unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>Everything I have read about Michael J. Sandel suggests he is an eloquent speaker who, like Creationism proponents with PhD’s, ha captured the lucrative market for “qualified people who oppose what is obviously right.” Media relates debate not consensus, so Sandel is quoted constantly. &nbsp;He is apparently garnering a lot of fame and fortune in Asia (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/opinion/friedman-the-professors-big-stage.html">link</a>).</p>
<p>This exactly reinforces <a title="Two arguments, one model?" href="http://priceroads.com/2013/04/09/two-arguments-one-model/">my post</a> about how people accept that travelers should pay for slowing others down but are upset by the prospect of paying for a slot.</p>

			<h1><a href="http://priceroads.com/2013/04/09/two-arguments-one-model/" title="Two arguments, one model?" rel="bookmark">Two arguments, one model?</a></h1>
                         <p>by admin  on April 9, 2013, no comments</p>   
            	<!-- END .entry-header -->
        
	<div class="entry-content">
						            
			<p>There are two very simple ways to argue for congestion pricing, and each has its graph. The first is the “marginal vs. average cost” argument, which says, “Drivers pay the average cost, not the marginal cost, so too many people enter the network,” or “You suffer the congestion that other &nbsp;drivers have caused already, but not the congestion that you cause.” The graph makes it clear: there’s a gap between the lines.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 584px"><p class="wp-caption-text">the “marginal cost” argument</p></div>
<p>This argument is powerful, because it draws on compensatory traditions of justice: clean up after yourself. Your car slows down the many other people in traffic, so you should have to pay something–if not to them, to the government that supplies their public services or perhaps the roadway itself.</p>
<p>However, this model differs from the one transportation economists typically use to model urban congestion: the Vickrey bottleneck model (or one of its elegant elaborations, including the one I have in the pipeline).</p>
<p>Summary: Think of an off-ramp to Central Business District. For physical reasons, it can only serve 4,000 vehicles per hour. But for economic reasons, 8,000 vehicles want to be served between 8 and 9 AM. Drivers line up at the ramp to wait their turn, wasting time better spent at home or work. Below a picture from Gonzales and Daganzo (2010). &nbsp;D(t) is a cumulative count of how many people pass. A(t) counts how many people arrive at the bottleneck. t~ is the time when the most people want to get to work. Ignore W(t)</p>
<div id="attachment_1120" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 454px"><a href="http://priceroads.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1-s2.0-S0191261512001026-gr1.jpg">the Vickrey bottleneck model w/ S-shaped wish curve</a><p class="wp-caption-text">the Vickrey bottleneck model w/ S-shaped wish curve</p></div>
<p>In the Vickrey bottleneck, a toll does not serve to speed up traffic. The ramp serves a certain number of people and that’s that. The toll, rather, serves to bring A(t) in line with D(t). More specifically, it serves to (a) prioritize people’s place in line at the queue; (b) relocate the time people spend in line at the ramp to time they spend at home before leaving for work or time they spend at work earlier than work really starts. The (b) effect occurs because, if the toll is structured to keep exactly 4,000 veh/hr arriving at the bottleneck, you can safely stay at home until you’d like to leave for work, confident that there won’t be a big, time-wasting line when you get to the bottleneck.</p>
<p>It’s important to note the differences in the justice arguments that flow from the two models. In the first, you are slowing everyone down. The first unmoors capacity, while the second fixes it and auctions off who gets it when. The cost you impose in the second one is that you took someone’s place, even though the social benefit of the overall tolling regime is that less time is spent idling.</p>
<p>There seems to be no intuitive tradition of justice in which to ground Vickrey’s argument for a toll at a bottleneck. In fact, there is a strong tradition of “first-come/first-serve,” which prevails because it has never been technological feasible to price slots for anything day-to-day. Therefore, it’s not surprising that planners and people getting masters degrees in public policy will never see the Vickrey model.</p>
<p>Of course, you get a marginal cost/average cost argument out of a Vickrey model, &nbsp;except that the costs are schedule delay.</p>
