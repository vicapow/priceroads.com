Interesting story in the NYTimes ([link](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/arts/design/in-cairo-rethinking-the-city-from-the-bottom-up.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0&hp)) from Cairo, which has about 60% the population density of NYC ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo)) and something less than 60% of the infrastructure:

After [the revolution two years ago](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html "Times article"), working-class residents of that vast informal neighborhood, tired of having no direct access to the 45-mile-long Ring Road, took matters into their own hands. In the absence of functioning government, they built ramps from dirt, sand and trash. Then they invited the police to open a kiosk at the interchange.

It will be interesting to see if people start charging tolls to pay for these little improvements.
