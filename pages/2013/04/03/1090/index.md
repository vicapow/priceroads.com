# [LA Syncs traffic lights](/2013/04/03/1090/ "LA Syncs traffic lights")

April 3, 2013

from the New York Times ([link](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/us/to-fight-gridlock-los-angeles-synchronizes-every-red-light.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0))

The system uses magnetic sensors in the road that measure the flow of traffic, hundreds of cameras and a centralized computer system that makes constant adjustments to keep cars moving as smoothly as possible. The city’s Transportation Department says the average speed of traffic across the city is 16 percent faster under the system, with delays at major intersections down 12 percent.

The improvements are presented as a boost to speed. There are two other metrics to consider: First, I’d like to see an estimate of the boost to flow; that is, a measure of the number of additional trips that can now reach downtown Los Angeles in a given hour. [Fosgerau and Small](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~ksmall/EndogenSchedPrefs.pdf) (2012) suggests we probably underestimate the benefits of getting people in and out of downtowns simultaneously. When there is variable capacity, as in the [Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_flow#Macroscopic_Fundamental_Diagram) framework, these could be big gains.

Another metric I’d like to see is accessibility, which is so important we should have a [Department of Accessibility](http://netdensity.net/2013/02/12/2989/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NetDensity+%28Net+Density%29). At the University of California Transportation Center conference in LA last month, I saw [Dr. Jonathan Levine](http://taubmancollege.umich.edu/faculty/directory/?sel=169) of U. Michigan make a convincing presentation that mobility measures (speed increases) are really only useful to the extent they represent gains in accessibility; that accessibility is the be-all-end-all of transport policy. The problem with capturing accessibility improvements for a city is that its metrics are specific to Origin-Destination pairs typically, so there is no general “marginal accessibility” improvement that you could tell a reporter. You would just present a map with changing colors on it I guess.
