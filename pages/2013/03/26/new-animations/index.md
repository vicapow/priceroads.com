Just about finished this new animation for the startup ViaAnalytics, founded by my advisor Carlos Daganzo and several Berkeley PhD/Post-docs. ViaAnalytics uses [control theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and wireless monitoring to improve bus service.

Also I’m working on a new animation about why we should use “gallons per 100 miles” instead of “miles per gallon.” It looks pretty good and will feature the vocal stylings of people with strong accents.
