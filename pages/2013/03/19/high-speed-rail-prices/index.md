(Note: this post is not about whether HSR is a good idea; it’s about how citizens come to that conclusion.)

When I first started studying transportation engineering, people would always try to relate by saying something good-natured like, “It’s a crime we don’t have high speed rail in this country.” One thing that struck me is that, although tons of young people in California love the idea of high speed rail, none know what the ticket prices, headways, or even travel times will be. This might not seem too odd, at first. How could they be expected to know every detail of a future system?

But the more I thought about it, the more bizarre it seemed. Price, travel time and headway are sin qua non in every single demand model for a simple reason: this trio is the fabric of the user experience of transit. They are not details but rather the only rational reasons you should want high-speed rail. Either (a) you want to enjoy these advantages of HSR yourself or (b) you want other people to shift out of planes and automobiles because they want to enjoy its superior price/travel time/headway combination. And, you can Google search to find out these details in about a minute.

If people are not merely uninformed but genuinely unconcerned about the actual experience of riding around on HSR, then why do they want it? Three things everyone I’ve talked with does know about HSR is (a) how fast it goes; (b) other countries have it; and (c) it’s greener than driving or flying. Since these are all people have to base their decision on, I assume people support HSR mainly because (a) it’s awesome to think about; (b) America should have what other countries have; and (c) we should recognize the reality of climate change.

I say “recognizing the reality of climate change,” not about actually curbing emissions, because in order to believe HSR would be successful at curbing emissions you’d have to know something about its ridership and hence its user experience. Moreover, in one of my city planning classes last semester we read all the facts and critiques of HSR in California, and when the teacher asked who still supported it, one very intelligent classmate said, “We need to start doing something about climate change in this country.” This was despite the fact we had really only been presented with evidence that undercut claims of HSR’s emission-reducing power.
