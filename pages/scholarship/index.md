# [Scholarship](/scholarship/)

A beta version of JSTOR, or "library"

Links to scholarly work on road pricing. Helps to know some calculus but you can also just read the abstracts and conclusions.

## Equity
* [Making Congestion Pricing Equitable](http://trb.metapress.com/content/qnwl0j8523408872/?p=a062d8afaac54210aad1b711fd49a72e&amp;pi=7) (2011). Thomas Light and Liisa Ecola. Two RAND  scholars review the literature on equity and offer ways to make cordon charges, area pricing, and HOT lanes equitable.
* [Just Pricing: the Distributional Effects of Congestion Pricing and Sales Taxes](http://www.springerlink.com/content/l168327363227298/) (2008). Lisa Schweitzer and Brian D. Taylor. A neat, philosophically-oriented paper. Lisa Schweitzer also has a [blog](http://lisaschweitzer.com/) on urban ethics and theory.

Those who oppose tolls and other forms of road pricing argue that low-income, urban residents will suffer if they must pay to use congested freeways. This contention, however, fails to consider (1) how much low-income residents already pay for transportation in taxes and fees, or (2) how much residents would pay for highway infrastructure under an alternative revenue-generating scheme, such as a sales tax.

* [Valuing time and reliability: assessing the evidence from road pricing demonstrations](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096585640400103X) (2005). Kenneth Small and David Brownstone. Time is really valuable:

Both sets of studies find that the value of time saved on the morning commute is quite high (between $20 and $40 per hour) when based on revealed behavior, and less than half that amount when based on hypothetical behavior.

## Pricing Rules

* [The Theory and Measurement of Private and Social Cost of Highway Congestion](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1911814?seq=1) (1961). AA Walters. Seminal. This would be the oldest road pricing paper you'd actually want to read, since Pigou (1920) and Knight (1924) came out when economists wrote more like Lord Byron than Greg Mankiw.
* [An Integrated Fares Policy for Transport in London](http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v9y1978i3p341-355.html) (1978). Stephen Glaister and David Lewis. Great illustration of second-best pricing techniques&#8211;how to set prices for bus and commuter rail when roads are underpriced. It's relevant to any city with a government-run public transit system. Be careful, though: their method requires knowledge of over 20 cross-price elasticities! Goes to show how much easier it is to just price roads and then use marginal cost pricing for transit.
* [Differentiated Road Pricing, Express Lanes and Carpools](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2006/03_roadpricing_winston/03_roadpricing_winston.pdf) (2006). Clifford Winston, Kenneth Small and Jia Yan. The authors argue that HOT lanes are not a good compromise between a free expressway and a fully-priced expressway. A good reason to consider HOT lanes more of a baby step than an end solution.

Simulations show that HOT lanes sometimes lower welfare compared with keeping all lanes in general use, particularly if they are priced high enough to allow motorists to travel at approximately free-flow speeds.

* [Second-Best Congestion Pricing: The Case of an Untolled Alternative](http://puff.lbl.gov/transportation/transportation/pdf/verhoef-1996.pdf) (2002). Verhoef et al. Journal of Urban Economics. How do you price one road when motorists can also choose to drive on a different, untolled road?
* [Estimating the Welfare Effects of Congestion Taxes: The Critical Importance of other Distortions within the Transport System](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009411900192248X) (2002). Ian Parry and Antonio Bento. Journal of Urban Economics. Distortions are so prevalent in urban transport that a first-best analysis of the welfare effects of congestion pricing is inadequate.

## Public Transportation
* [Road Pricing and Public Transport](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885904090067) (2004). Kenneth A. Small. A technical exposition of a virtuous cycle between road pricing and bus transit, with statistics from London's congestion charge. This piece later begot a more accessible distillation in Access magazine [link](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~ksmall/Access%2026%20-%2003%20-%20Road%20Pricing%20and%20Public%20Transit.pdf)).
* [Pricing In Urban and Suburban Transport](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1823886). (1963). William S. Vickrey. American Economic Review. Nobel laureate William Vickrey explains how badly priced both roads and public transit are.

## Politics & Revenues
* [Using the Revenues from Congestion Pricing](http://128.200.36.2/its/publications/papers/ITS/UCI-ITS-WP-92-4.pdf) (1992). Kenneth A. Small. Proposes two-thirds for travel allowances and tax cuts targeted at commuters. One third for better highways and transit to business centers. An oft-cited analysis.
* [The Political Economy of of Highway Tolls and Congestion](http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=371072) (1992). Jose A. Gomez-Ibanez. Transportation Quarterly. Why is &#8220;piecemeal tolling&#8221; so popular in the United States relative to other countries?
* [The Political Calculus of Congestion Pricing](http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/PoliticalCalculus.pdf) (2007) . David King, Michael Manville, and Donald Shoup. Transport Policy. UCLA planning scholars' contrarian proposal that, congestion pricing revenues should go to local governments instead of getting rebated to taxpayers.
