The [HOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_occupancy/toll_and_express_toll_lanes) (High-Occupancy Toll) lanes concept is facing a litmus test in Georgia. On October 3, the state converted 16 miles of I-85 from HOV to HOT lanes and raised the minimum HOV occupancy from two passengers to three.

The public hated losing the two-person minimum, and the initial toll was far too high. TollRoadsNews has a [good summary](http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/5540). Even after Gov. Nathan Deal lowered the tolls, many drivers chose to sit in the congested free lanes rather than pay. This accords with behavioral economics research such as[Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1986)](http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/5540), whichshows consumers will suffer personal losses to punish suppliers who violate community standards of fairness.

According to the [Atlanta Journal-Constitution](http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/states-hot-lane-request-1237791.html), Gov. Deal asked the FHWA for some relief for two-person carpools:

“The governor would like to see some accommodation for commuters with two-person car pools, even if it’s simply a reduced fare,” said Brian Robinson, spokesman for Gov. Nathan Deal.

His request was denied.I understand the FHWA’s position, but I worry that their orthodoxy will endanger the HOT lanes brand.

I think Gov. Deal presented a sensible compromise.After all, if single-passenger vehicles pay a toll but three-passenger vehicles pay none, it seemsintuitivelyfair that two-passenger vehicles would pay something between zero and full price.
