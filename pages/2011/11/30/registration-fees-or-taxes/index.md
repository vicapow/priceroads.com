# [Fees or Taxes?](/2011/11/30/registration-fees-or-taxes/)


Ben Wear of the Austin Statesman gets it [right on the money](http://www.statesman.com/news/local/a-fee-by-any-name-smells-sweeter-than-1966893.html):

The vehicle registration fee, on the other hand, is a kind of a flat tax. As of Sept. 1, all Texas vehicles under 6,000 pounds pay $52.75 a year, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a Mercedes or a Taurus, or how old the car is. The fee is the same whether the owner drives the wheels off, or parks it in the garage indefinitely. And you pay it all at once, not a little bit at a time like the gas tax.

If you want good roads, you will pay for them somehow. If Texans shout down gas taxes and road pricing, they will end up with vehicle registration “fees.” Unfortunately, the fee is not related to the traffic, noise and pollution you create, nor theasphaltyou deteriorate.

The historic motivation for vehicle registration fees is kind of interesting, though.

Originally, there was little congestion or pollution. This made the marginal cost of car trip close to zero, and optimal pricing demands that price equals marginal cost (as you can see in this [neat java applet](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/mcpricing.htm)). But we had to come up with the money to fund all those roads, so governments instituted a mix of vehicle fees and low gas taxes.
