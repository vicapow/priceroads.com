# [Virginia is for HOT lanes](/2011/12/07/virginia-is-for-hot-lanes/)


[via Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-officials-reach-tentative-deal-for-i-95-hot-lanes/2011/12/06/gIQAbq14aO_story.html) The Virginia DOT and Fluor-Transurban, a private firm, have struck a deal to build 29 miles of HOT lanes outside DC. The main points:

*   29 miles
*   Virginia pays $97 million
*   Fluor-Transurban pays $843 million
*   14 mi. of existing HOV lanes converted to HOT lanes, expanded from 2 to 3 lanes
*   15 miles of 2-lane, reversible HOT lanes slated for the median
*   Connects to [14-miles](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/beltway-drivers-to-encounter-new-phase-of-construction-in-virginia/2011/04/05/AF34Kk9C_story.html) of Beltway HOT lanes under construction now
*   Connects to HOV lanes on 395 going into DC from the beltway
*   3-passenger minimum to ride free
*   Virginia will invest $200 million in expanded bus service and 3,000 park-and-ride lots

This is a HUGE deal.

Virginia DOT wanted HOT lanes running all the way into DC, but these plans were crushed by activists in Arlington, VA. I wonder if bottlenecks willoccurwhen price-paying motorists hit the beltway and merge with normal traffic.

Virginia is smart to invest $200 million in bus service. This makes bus riders into HOT lanes stakeholders.

Unlike the Atlanta HOT lanes, this project uses two and three lanes. Thus, these HOT lanes will move much faster (since you can pass people while staying in the HOT lanes), and drivers will perceive a greater service differential.These HOT lanes connect to other HOT lanes on the beltway, laying the groundwork for a full HOT lanes network.

It will be interesting to see how much money Fluor-Transurban makes off the tolls. Virginia is giving a private firm existing HOV lanes and medians. But is Virginia going to let Fluor-Transurban keep 100% of the revenue forever? Itâ€™s unclear what the terms are.
