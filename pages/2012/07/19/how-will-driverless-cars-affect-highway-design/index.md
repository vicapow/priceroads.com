[Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/clifford-whinston-on-driverless-cars.html) has passages from this gated WSJ piece by Clifford Winston of Brookings:

Driverless cars don’t need the same wide lanes, which would allow highway authorities to reconfigure roads to allow travel speeds to be raised during peak travel periods. All that is needed would be illuminated lane dividers that can increase the number of lanes available. Driverless cars could take advantage of the extra lane capacity to reduce congestion and delays.

Another design flaw is that highways have been built in terms of width and thickness to accommodate both cars and trucks. The smaller volume of trucks should be handled with one or two wide lanes with a road surface about a foot thick, to withstand trucks’ weight and axle pressure. But the much larger volume of cars—which apply much less axle pressure that damages pavement—need more and narrower lanes that are only a few inches thick.

Building highways that separate cars and trucks by directing them to lanes with the appropriate thickness would save taxpayers a bundle. It would also favor the technology of driverless cars because they would not have to distinguish between cars and trucks and to adjust speeds and positions accordingly.

Differentiating lanes strikes me as exactly the kind of innovation we would expect from a private road operator. However, governments have already shown willingness to differentiate lanes by use, such as HOT lanes, HOV lanes, bus lanes and bikes lanes.

I’m not sure how likely it is that we’ll see lane-widths changed in response to driverless vehicles. Although no one would mind the equilibrium after the change, it’s the move that matters. It’s hard to tell people “cars are safer, so we’re going to make the roads more dangerous,” even though there is a continuum of lanes wider than the existing widths that no one is especially pushing for…as if the current lane width were magically just right.

Consider that America still hasn’t adopted the metric system.
