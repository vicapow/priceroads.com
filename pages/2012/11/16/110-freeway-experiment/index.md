The 110 in LA has express lanes as of Saturday.

[L.A.’s first freeway toll lanes off to smooth start, officials say](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/la-110-freeway-toll-lanes-smooth-start.html)

Tolls vary from 25 cents to $1.40 a mile, depending on congestion and demand. Officials aim to keep travel speeds in the express lanes at least 45 miles per hour. They estimate the average toll for a motorist will be between $4 and $7 a trip, although it could be as much as $15.40. Officials estimate the lanes could save motorists as much as two to three minutes a mile.

These are pretty expensive rates. If you paid $15.40 for 11 miles and saved 2.5 minutes/mile that’d be about $30/hour value of travel time savings. The express lanes are a pilot meant to last one year. Like other express lanes, the authorities are targeting speeds instead of flows.
