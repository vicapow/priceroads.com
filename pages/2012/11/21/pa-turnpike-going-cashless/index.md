This is big news:

— In what it’s calling one of the most ambitious efforts in the nation, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission plans to convert to all-electronic tolling within five years, scrapping the need for drivers to pass through tollbooths.

They’re using cameras for people without EZ-Pass. Not everyone is a winner, though, and I doubt this would have happened if the state government were Democratic:

The Turnpike currently employs 755 unionized toll collectors, along with 100 nonunion employees, who’d be out of a job if the transition happens, according to published reports. It costs about $67 million a year to run the toll plazas, with the cost rising to $77 million by 2014, those reports indicated.
