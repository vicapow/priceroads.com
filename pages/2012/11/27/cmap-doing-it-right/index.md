The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) is continuing its campaign to actually convince people that congestion pricing is a good idea. Randy Blankenhorn, Executive Director of CMAP, has written a [letter-to-the-editor](http://heraldnews.suntimes.com/opinions/letters/16515024-474/letters-congestion-pricing-a-boon.html)

With congestion pricing, toll rates in express lanes rise at times when more drivers want to use the highway and fall when demand is low. Supply and demand will help manage highway resources more effectively. CMAP has created www.cmap.illinois.gov/congestion-pricing, with information about the benefits to our region’s residents.

In the past 20 years, 10 states have successfully implemented congestion pricing, and public support has increased as drivers become familiar with it. While express-lane revenue could help pay for some of a roadway’s costs, the primary goal of congestion pricing is to manage traffic more effectively.

With construction approaching for two new expressways and new lanes on existing ones, now is the time for our state and region to make a strong commitment to congestion pricing. It’s a crucial step to shorten travel times and maximize the benefit of these planned improvements.
