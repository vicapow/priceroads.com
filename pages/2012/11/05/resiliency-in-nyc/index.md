The Antiplanner has a bold [policy recommendation](http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=7092) for NYC:

There are two alternatives to rebuilding the subways. The drastic alternative is to simply let the city fend for itself without subways. A more realistic alternative would be to convert the subways into underground busways. Electric buses could move just about as many people as the subways do with far less infrastructure.

Battery-powered buses in particular would require almost no infrastructure other than rechargers (and the tunnels themselves, of course, which as far as I know weren’t damaged by the storm). At eighteen feet in height, the tunnels are tall enough for double-decker buses, which should be able to move about as many people per hour as the subway trains. With minimal added infrastructure, the buses could even be[driverless](http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/environmental_rep/03/jigyou02.html), making them far less expensive to operate and maintain than rails.

Being a small government advocate, O’Toole has a dog in this fight: he believes it would save a lot of money. Apart from size-of-government issues, we should also examine the rail/bus trade-off through the lens of resiliency.

First, resiliency is good marketing. Economists are fond of talking about cost-effectiveness of buses, but cost-effectiveness does not actually mean anything to most voters, who do not believe in fungibility of funding and have never in the history of policy been impressed with the phrase “revenue neutral.” Resiliency is something voters can understand.

Second, resiliency is a hot topic in light of [Nassim Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb)‘s (Black Swan bro) work popularizing the importance of inconceivably random events.

It seems that an electrically-powered bus system would be far more resilient than a rail system. Both require electricity, but buses require less fixed-cost infrastructure, which is expensive to replace in the event of earthquake/hurricane/terrorist attack. Buses also require less specialized labor, and there are far more suppliers of bus parts and maintenance than rail parts and maintenance.

I have also thought of what it would mean for resiliency if Mayor Bloomberg’s congestion pricing scheme had been implemented but come to no obvious conclusions.
