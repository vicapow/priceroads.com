# [Free to Build](/2012/11/30/free-to-build/ "Free to Build")

November 30, 2012


Yesterday in my land use class we were going over Smart Growth policies, and it occurred to me that the deregulation part of the Smart Growth agenda should be independently branded for conservative/libertarian consumption. That aspect is comprised of eliminating minimum parking requirements while easing height limits, minimum lot sizes, setbacks, restrictions on multifamily housing, etc. “This could be so easy to market!” I thought.

After doing a search I find Bryan Caplan already [beat me to the point](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/11/free_to_build_t.html):

How about this: A populist movement to drastically reduce the price of housing by slashing the regulatory barriers to new construction? Uh oh, it still sounds like an egghead is talking. Real populism means sound bytes. My best shot so far:Free to Build.

Here are some preliminary slogans:

“You shouldn’t have to be rich to buy a nice home.”

“Think of our children! They deserve homes of their own too.” (And if you remain convinced that voters are selfish, try “Do you want your kids to live with your until they’re 40?!”)

(For privately-owned land) “They own it, why can’t they do something useful with it?”

(For publicly-owned land) “We own it, why can’t we do something useful with it?”

I can imagine the commercials running in my home state of Alabama:

Open on an elderly, African American homeowner lady (Eleanor) and a property developer (Ben) in a tie cause he’s professional but with his sleeves rolled up cause he gets the job done.

“When the jobs went away, my savings all but dried up,” she says over a “For Sale” sign and a brief shot of Obama smoking. “Then Ben approached me.”

“We let her know we could build folks some real nice condos and even create a few jobs on the way,” says Ben over shots of Caterpillars and construction workers eating out of metal lunchboxes.

Cut to black and white of an office with a feeble Poindexter pushing paper at a desk. His sleeves are notably down and festooned with cuff links.

Narrator: “But government bureaucrats won’t let Ben build on Eleanor’s land.”

“Unfortunately, city hall ruled that condos were too good for Homewood,” says Ben. “That it would harm the character.”

“We can’t just let people do what they want with their land!” says the bureaucrat speaking with the effete intonation of a New England Brahmin.

“I don’t know what I'm going to leave my grand kids now,”cries Eleanor.

Narrator: “Let big government planners they work for TAXPAYERS like YOU! Vote Yes on Amendment 12.”

It would also help to somehow identify the practice of zoning with France (Le Cobusier?), Chicago Politics, or latte’s. It is impossible to overdo a political ad in Alabama, where the TV climate approaches Super Bowl levels of awesomeness during campaign season:
