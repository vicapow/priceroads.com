# [O’Toole and Messaging](/2012/12/04/otoole-and-messaging/ "O’Toole and Messaging")

December 4, 2012

Randall O’Toole, the Antiplanner, provides a valuable public service by opposing wasteful transit. But his messaging could be better. O’Toole is at his best when promoting buses as superior to rail and streetcars. He is least effective when telling communities they fundamentally shouldn’t want what they want.In his recent post on San Antonio’s streetcars, O’Toole [points out](http://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=7198):

My report showed that streetcars are just plain inferior to buses in every possible way. They are slower; can’t carry as many people per hour; prone to system failure (if one is disabled, every car on the line has to stop); can’t easily respond to changes in travel habits; and are far more expensive than buses.

That’s something your concerned citizen can get on board with. You want to build transit? Well, buses are your best option.However, O’Toole’s arguments about bus advantages are overshadowed in the news. Here is what[ got reported](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Both-sides-rail-over-planned-streetcars-4073905.php#ixzz2E6s7ANQd):

San Antonio, he said, “is a modern city, and it doesn’t need a downtown.”

Hmmm. My guess is that a radical opinion like this taints all of your arguments in the eyes of someone concerned about their community as a singular, aesthetically satisfying entity–like people who hold sway these matters tend to do. O’Toole’s statement is couched against the following:

One was[Lynn Knapik](http://www.mysanantonio.com/?controllerName=search&action=search&channel=news%2Flocal_news&search=1&inlineLink=1&query=%22Lynn+Knapik%22), 65, who moved downtown two years ago, leaving behind her house and North Side living. She’s single; her children are grown; and for the first time in her life, she feels like she lives in a neighborhood.

Streetcar would be like the icing on the cake, she said. A Realtor, Knapik imagined taking her clients on the streetcar to tour downtown residences.

“Plus,” she said, “you’d be selling the whole lifestyle of it.”

Now it’s Professor Outsider McThinkTank against an elderly business-lady with a dream and a cake metaphor. Here and in other coverage, reporters highlight the fact O’Toole opposes all public transit subsidies. O’Toole is also very honest and intellectual in his dealings with the public. He could get more done by vaguer thoughts that don’t condemn streetcars outright but rather make San Antonio seem like a very special case where they won’t work:

“San Antonio is special, and it deserves home-grown solutions. One size doesn’t fit all. I don’t know if you’ve checked the weather forecast this morning, but it’s safe to sayI’m not in Oregon anymore[chuckles from the crowd]. San Antonio needs to build on home-grown success stories like the cutting edgePrimo bus rapid transit system.”

I run into this all the time even in my daily life. I help my parents manage their money, and my dad will never ever believe that index funds do just as well as managed funds. I tried explaining this to him a couple of times, and he can’t get over the idea that a man who went to Harvard reading the Wall Street Journal will make lots of money with magical judgement calls. What my dad wants, fundamentally, is to be able to think about somebody smart fretting over his money. Since he wants this, I got him into some very low fee Vanguard funds.
