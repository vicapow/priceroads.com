Apparently South Africa is going ahead with its road tolls despite huge opposition from the trade union COSATU. I am mainly interested in the types of arguments people make against road tolling. Here are some excerpts from COSATUâ€™s manifesto ([link](http://www.cosatu.org.za/show.php?ID=5918))

First and foremost, the tolls will add to the burdens of the poor.

The tolls will put a direct burden on the poor of Gauteng and our country broadly, who will be forced to pay for traveling on the tolled roads.

Our second objection is that the tolls will perpetuate exclusion

The logic of those who say that the poor do not use our motorways, except by public transport, is that they should be permanently excluded from access to the best roads. They must find the potholed side-roads to get from A to B, while the rich glide along in their fancy cars.

Our third objection is that public transport is totally inadequate

We acknowledge that government has now exempted registered public transport vehicles from the tolls. However, the fact of the matter is that public transport remains woefully inadequate both in quality and in the numbers of people that it serves.

A third of our people use private cars to get to and from work. This is not a free choice. It is because our public transport system is expensive, unsafe, and unreliable.

Finally, the tolls represent a form of privatization, which we have always been opposed to

COSATU has an unwavering record of being opposed to privatization. The introduction of a tolling system that brings in the private sector to operate the tolled roads is, in our view, nothing else but privatization.

With the exception of privatization, these are essentially the same lines of opposition to tolling in the United States: the welfare of the poor, inequality of access (different than welfare concerns), and lack of public transport options. This shows why congestion pricing has really only happened in societies that redistribute a lot of income and have good public transport. The exception, Singapore, has a unique political balance.
