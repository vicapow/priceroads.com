[Meet Sam Schwartz](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/opinion/keller-meet-sam-schwartz.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1): Bill Keller, former editor of the NYTimes, endorses Gridlock Sam’s congestion pricing plan.

You do not have to be an engineer to appreciate the logic. The scheme puts the heaviest onus on the solo driver who has ready access to a train, and lowers the cost for drivers who have no alternative. Unlike earlier plans that amounted to a punishing tax on commuters from outlying communities, the Schwartz plan has more affluent neighborhoods (like the plusher parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens) pay a fair share. Though the main purpose is to underwrite public transport, the plan sets aside money to make the highways more bearable — in part so trucks will use them and avoid the populous business districts.
