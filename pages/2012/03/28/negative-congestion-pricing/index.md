The Atlantic Cities Blog asks [‘Should We Pay People to Drive Off Peak](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2012/03/should-we-pay-people-drive-peak/1586/)?’

Congestion pricing is an economics-based approach to the traffic problem that focuses on punishing certain behaviors: in this case, driving during peak hours. But a good deal of psychological evidence suggests that rewards are often more effective than punishments at changing behavior.

This strategy is product of cognitive illusion. Because congestion pricing and off-peak payments accomplish the same goal, our minds pit them as alternatives to be traded off against one another. But congestion pricing is a revenue source, and off-peak payments are an expenditure. There is no trade-off. It’s like saying that reading is more effective than Doritos.

To be fair, the Netherlands carried out a field trial of this strategy and compared it favorably to a road pricing stated preference survey:

This time the researchers recruited nearly 350 people who commuted regularly to The Hague on the A12 roadway from Zoetermeer, a commuter city. The commuters were offered a daily reward (between 3 and 7 euros) if they didn’t drive the A12 between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m. and instead either drove at another time or commuted by another mode.

…

With all that said, Tillema and colleagues found that about 37 percent of car trips were diverted from rush hour in the rewards scheme, compared to only about 15 percent estimated to change times in the pricing plan.

If the Dutch were only able to divert 15 percent of traffic with a pricing plan, then the price in their pricing plan was too low. Also, this system becomes complicated quickly. If it’s only for rush-hour commuters, how can you verify that someone would have gone to work at rush hour otherwise? It’s like paying out a ‘healthy eating’ subsidy to everyone who swears they would have otherwise eaten Moonpies for breakfast. Anyway, no actual cities are flush enough to do this. My home county recently [fell off a cliff according to the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/business/jefferson-county-ala-falls-off-the-bankruptcy-cliff.html?pagewanted=all). Actually, I just found an exception:

Good luck Dubai.
