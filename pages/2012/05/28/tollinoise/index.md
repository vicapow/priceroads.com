From the Chicago Sun-Times ([link](http://www.suntimes.com/12746292-761/could-drivers-be-able-to-pay-their-way-out-of-traffic-congestion.html))

Drivers could be given the option of paying more for a less-congested commute as part of a plan to rebuild and widen I-90 from O’Hare to Rockford.

It’s called congestion pricing and it would give people the choice to pay a fee for a better commute.

Pricing would be part of a massive widening project, similar to the beltway HOT lanes in DC.

The goal is to link Rockford to O’Hare Airport with eight lanes from the Kennedy Expressway to Randall Road and six lanes from Randall Road to I-39.

The eight-lane portion would be 34.3 miles, and the 6-lane portion would be 37.9 miles. If Chicagoans can enjoy 140 new lane-miles without paying more taxes, it’s a pretty good deal–although it’s not stated explicitly that the new lanes will be entirely self-financed.

In other news, some of Europe is about to go broke. The last time that happened they sold off lots of state property–steel mills and airlines and such. I wonder if this time they’ll give up the roads and, if so, what mechanism they’ll use for the auction.
