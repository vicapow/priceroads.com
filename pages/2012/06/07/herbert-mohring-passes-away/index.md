The guy who first formalized the Mohring Effect has passed away in Minneapolis. From [The Transportationist](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/levin031/transportationist/2012/06/herbert-mohring.html):

Lee Munnich passes on news that famed transportation economist, Herb Mohring, passed away on June 4.

This is poignant because I am making an animation called “Tom Jones Explains the Mohring Effect.”

He researched road pricing, and the link above links to his work.
