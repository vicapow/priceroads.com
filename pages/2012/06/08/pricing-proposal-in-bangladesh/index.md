Finance Minister AMA Muhith came up with an idea to ease the ever-deteriorating traffic congestion by introducing road pricing and taxing people into carpooling.

“In order to ease traffic congestion, sedan cars should not be allowed to ply the city roads unless three passengers travel together. Otherwise, extra toll should be imposed,” Muhith said.

“I believe if we can properly enforce traffic rules and introduce road pricing, traffic congestion will not only be reduced, additional resources will be generated for road maintenance,” he said, adding that toll collection system should be introduced for roads and bridges wherever possible.

The idea came up during his budget speech in parliament yesterday while he was speaking about the communication sector.

Transport management expert Prof Shamsul Hoque of Buet’s civil engineering department termed the idea a good one but said it was not feasible in Bangladesh as cities of the country were unplanned and all modes of transport use the same piece of road in a chaotic manner.

I doubt that pricing will happen given the transaction costs and, as Prof Shamsul Hoque points out, chaotically diverse traffic stream in Bangladeshi cities. However, it says something about the ubiquity of the idea that this was proposed publicly.

I feel confident this idea was heard because Bangladesh is a Commonwealth nation. Even to people who despise the memory of the colonial era, what happens in the UK carries special salience; and that goes for the London congestion charge. During my time here, I’ve been amazed at the extent of intellectual exchange among Britain and her former colonies. The UK sends out experts to these countries, and their own people come in droves to earn degrees and conduct research. I think the Commonwealth is the most underrated (in America) international phenomenon.
