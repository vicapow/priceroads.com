               <h1><a href="/2013/03/29/autonomous-vehicles-and-urban-form/" title="autonomous vehicles and urban form">autonomous vehicles and urban form</a></h1>
<p>March 29, 2013</p>
<p>Issi Romem, a fellow grad student here at Berkeley whom I’ve never met, draws attention to the impact of driverless vehicles on urban form: (<a href="http://cityminded.org/how-will-driverless-cars-affect-our-cities-6526">link</a>)</p>
<p>I disagree with Romem’s predictions for engineering reasons. I know what he’s thinking: the price of distance drops, so people consume more distance. But there is more here than meets the eye.</p>
<p>First, travel time is consumed not in traversing distance but rather in traversing queues. To the degree they enable higher speeds and reduce accidents, autonomous vehicles will merely allow us to ore frequently rub the fundamental capacity constraints of bottlenecks. Capacities of existing bottlenecks will certainly rise with AV’s, but I have not seen evidence they will rise much in mixed traffic with both AV’s and non-AV’s.</p>
<p>To put it another way, the automobile allowed sprawl because it went faster and because authorities expanded the network with automobiles in mind. If authorities had kept our pre-automobile network in place, the speed and reliability of the invention would quickly run up against the limits of the infrastructure, and almost the entirety of any trip would have been spent at intersections or accelerating and decelerating</p>
<p>Therefore,AV’s will only beget sprawl if authorities supply more capacity at bottlenecks–which doesn’t seem to currently interest our DOT’s as much as network expansion–or if authorities change roads capes specifically for AV’s by changing the lane widths. I believe this is unlikely because of status quo bias and loss aversion on the part of the non-AV minority. Modern transportation policy, increasingly democratic, is very much guided by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness">difference principle</a>.</p>
<p>Second, if cars are really going to be in service all the time, there are large gains to locating near other origins and destinations. AV sharing will exhibit the same economies as bike sharing and taxi service. If I live in rural CA my car might take a while, and every minute it travels deadheaded on the trip to pick up me in my far-flung location is another minute of money cost I accrue.</p>
<p>Finally, major sprawl periods occur when population grows. Except for the crime-driven exodus of the 60′s through 80′s, my understanding is that sprawl has typically happened when people immigrated from rural to metropolitan areas or from other countries. Philadelphia is famous for the starfish pattern the streetcar left on it, but I doubt that the streetcar actually decreased the population of its inner city much. People have overestimated the “flight” cause of sprawl relative to the immigration tendency.</p>
<p>One thing I believe we would agree on is that scale transit will become obsolete.</p>
