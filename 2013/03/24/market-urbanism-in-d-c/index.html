<p>March 24, 2013</p>
<p>Over at Market Urbanism, Emily Washington <a href="http://marketurbanism.com/2013/03/07/many-market-urbanist-elements-in-dcs-zoning-rewrite/">compiles all the land deregulation</a> coming to Washington, DC. It’s good news for <a href="http://www.vtpi.org/access.pdf">accessibility</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration">agglomeration</a>economies and affordable housing.</p>
<p>Urban land deregulation(allowing tall buildings, eliminating minimum parking requirements, letting people put apartments in their garages) is an uphill battle right now, but I predict it will come about more quickly than meets the eye. Social science variables, especially deregulation, tend to form sigmoid curves. Sigmoid curves have flat slopes at first–meaning little change happens every year–but then wax quickly. And there has never been a slow deregulation.</p>
<p><img src="http://priceroads.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sigmoid-01.jpg" alt="sigmoid-01"></p>
<p>We see fast deregulation today with with gay marriage and immigration and charter schools. America freed 100% of millions of slaves in five years. Britain privatized nearly 100% of its bus service between 1985 and 1988. In the other direction, regulation proceeded just as breathlessly in the Progressive Era and New Deal/WWII.</p>
<p>Here I’m engaging in “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting">reference class forecasting</a>,” meaning comparing a phenomenon to others in its class rather than staring at its particulars. Because humans–me included–are story-telling machines with terrible biases toward availability and representativeness, I’m skeptical of analyzing the facts of a social science situation too much. But I’ll give it a shot:</p>
<p>Ten years ago, land deregulation was barely on the agenda. Now, it’s creeping up the docket. Politicians are at least cognizant that respectable people support it, and NIMBY is familiar slander. Add to the mix: universal support among the academics who train planners, the sanctity of “cutting emissions” as a justification for urban policy, falling crime rates, expensive housing, and higher tolerance of all types. In contrast, there are zero trends supporting more land deregulation. There are <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/schleicher_david">acclaimed professors</a>who think about how to up zone urban land all day, but none who do the opposite.</p>
<p>Since there are no reasons to expect more regulations and many reasons for less of it, expect less of it. And since social science variables never move linearly, expect lots of deregulation happening quickly in some undeterminable year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most pundits are inept at thinking beyond first-order changes (the blue tangent lines). They make a prediction based on current slope, then revise it upward or downward every so often.</p>
