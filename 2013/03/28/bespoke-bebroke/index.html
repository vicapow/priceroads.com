<p>March 28, 2013</p>
<p>Arlington, VA is spending about $1 million each for 24 bus stops: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57576724/$1m-exposed-d.c.-area-bus-stop-leaves-straphangers-out-in-the-rain/">link</a>. Each has room to shield about 15 people, although not very well.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/03/21/Others/Images/2013-03-21/_MG_84201363882028.jpg" alt="">
$1 million bus stop; Washington Post</p>
<p>The <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-24/local/37989853_1_bus-shelter-new-bus-streetcars">Post</a> says that federal and state money paid for 80% of the cost. It’s an old story: other people’s money.</p>
<p>Transportation funding might not change. So what could lower the ceteris paribus cost of infrastructure? Clearly, local government will always be sloppy with other people’s money, but a imprudence has different results at Wal-Mart than at Tiffany’s.</p>
<p>Over the past century, Americans have gotten way better at making food, electronics, and cars. On a per-unit-of-input basis, we’ve gotten worse at higher education, basic health care and government construction. What stands out here is that everything bespoke has gotten more expensive and gold-plated.</p>
<p>Economists would point to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol">Baumol’s cost disease</a>, but I think we should really look at technological improvement in rent-seeking. Clearly, over many years of working government projects, a contractor will get better at something profitable. Will it learn to make a given quality of bus stop with the least labor and material? Or will it learn to capture more and larger contracts with the same labor and material? It looks like the latter has been more profitable.</p>
<p>I think the only way ahead is to substitute mass-produced projects for bespoke ones. A giant firm selling alike projects to thousands of governments really might profit from cutting costs and prices. For construction, this model is harder than it is for toys. Construction requires “boots on the ground” and hence local firms and hence monopolistic bidding and rent-seeking.</p>
<p>But given the surplus here is tremendous, I think someone will find a way to take a bite of it with lower costs. By surplus I mean not merely the profits in the construction industry but the immense societal gains of building more and better infrastructure…time saved, lives saved, stress reduced, communities beautified. We are already seeing tiny points of light in highway construction, through a field called “accelerated construction.” Here is a <a href="http://http//www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/us/rapid-construction-techniques-transform-infrastructure-repair.html?pagewanted=all">New York Times article</a> about a bridge built out of pre-made parts inMassachusetts. <a href="http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/construction/accelerated/">Here</a> is an FHWA site about the practice. I sincerely hope mass production of infrastructure proceeds apace.</p>
