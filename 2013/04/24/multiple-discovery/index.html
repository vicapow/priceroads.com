<p>Quoted in Li &amp; Vitanyi,<em>An introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications</em>, 1st ed., p. 83.</p>
<p><a href="http://priceroads.com/2013/04/21/an-easier-agenda/" title="an easier agenda">Sunday</a> I said the GOP should neglect the justice of top marginal tax rates and instead lay claim to the supply-side economics of the middle class. On Monday Bryan Caplan urged his corps of free-market economists to do something similar (<a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/04/the_grave_evil.html">link</a>). The post is probably going to be a classic, brimming with Caplan’s characteristic iconoclasm.</p>
<p>Instead of downplaying the grave evil of unemployment, we free-market economists should urge governments to redouble their efforts to fight it. How can we do so and remain free-market economists? First and foremost, by emphasizing the obvious: Every government imposes a vast array of employment-destroying regulations.</p>
<p>I want to draw a contrast between what I proposed, which I think is a viable Republican agenda, and Caplan’s proposed assault on government barriers to employment. I emphasized the supply side of middle class labor: pro-accessibility policies (eliminating bottlenecks and allowing a dense built environment) that make market production more attractive than household production, payroll tax cuts that lower worker’s own reservation wages, and reforming disability programs that actively discourage work. Although innovative among free-marketeers in that he takes nominal wage rigidity seriously, Caplan is still just thinking about hiring costs.</p>
<p>The real nut, though, is Caplan’s point about ideology. I’ll paraphrase:today’s environment determines which arguments are intuitive and thus the policies of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Free-market economists should be especially dismayed by the cultural and political effects of unemployment. When every able-bodied worker can easily find a place to sell his skills, the economy reveals a clear connection between moral desert and practical success [...] Once people lose their confidence that every able-bodied person can easily take care of himself, this individualist ethos withers – and the welfare state grows like a weed.</p>
<p>Right on! And he correctly identifies which awful policy is responsible: tight money.</p>
<p>Imagine how much statist legislation could have been averted if the world’s central banks had kept NGDP on a steady course from 2008 to the present.</p>
<p>If there had not been a great Recession, it would have been far, far easier to argue for congestion pricing. When millions of Americans fell close to the margin of poverty, every marginal slice of income taken by tolls meant a scary step closer to the line of ‘not making it,’ and, for better or for worse, there are no food stamps for household transportation budges.</p>
<p>Alex Tabarokk says steady NGDP is why Australia has maintained the least intuitive market policies (<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/03/australia-notes.html">evidence</a>). Sometimes it’s sobering to recall that, for all the cool work we are doing in transportation, it is nibbling around the edges compared to what better monetary policy would accomplish. And yet, nothing I’ve read by Scott Sumner suggests that the actual research agenda of modern macro is at all that enlightening. All of the important truths are decades old, and the relevant mission of macroeconomists is correcting their rock stars’ cruel heterodoxy (<a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=5924">link</a>). If someone made an animation explaining MV = PY, countering the folk-Austrian mind-filth smeared all over the Internet (like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWH5TlbloU">garbage </a>that Ezra Pound would have watched on repeat in his asylum), he or she’d be more important to policy than 99% of hard-won macro theses.</p>
<p>This concludes my blogging for a while. Finals are coming, and I’ve got to publish.</p>
