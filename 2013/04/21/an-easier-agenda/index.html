<p>(a post only marginally about transportation)</p>
<p>What is the Republican Party’s focus? Just ask, “Which causes capture the marginal returns on the party’s investments of political capital?” The GOP has often gambled political capital on uncertain drives for policies that help rich people, like Social Security privatization, while ignoring bets that would shrink government but don’t help rich people, like easing occupational licensing.</p>
<p>What would be an easier, yet distinctly conservative, agenda for the party?</p>
<p>Matt Yglesias highlights one alternative (<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/03/conservatism_for_the_working_class_lower_taxes_and_fewer_services.html">link</a>):</p>
<p>But this debate leaves off the table a third option that ought to be considered more frequently in America—cut spending in order to cut taxes on the masses.</p>
<p>Like maybe instead of subsidized health insurance premiums and college tuition we should give people money. Money can be used to pay college tuition. But it can also be used to pay for a vacation. Colleges would have to make the case that their educational offerings are more valuable than a great vacation. Conservatives, more broadly, could challenge liberals to a real debate about the value proposition of government services.</p>
<p>I agree, but here Matt only talks about the composition of the pie, not its size. I’d go further: Republicans should revel in the supply side economics of the middle class. Middle class labor force participation rates are falling, especially for young people and working-class males.</p>
<p>To date, both Republicans and Democrats have advertised strictly demand side solutions. While Democrats increasingly demand more government hiring (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/opinion/brooks-the-progressive-shift.html">David Brooks opines</a>) and Republicans demand tax cuts for ‘job creators,’ both sides have essentially taken the supply of middle class workers for granted. Republicans have completely forgotten the Reagan-era intellectualvocabulary of elastic labor supply (when top marginal tax rates reached the 70%’s) but preserved the concern for rich people’s well-being.</p>
<p>And in a perverse Telephone Game played over decades, this heuristic of asking “What’s in it for the rich?” has led the party to seek tax increases on the middle class. That’s right,the party of supply side economics wants toraisetaxes on the portion of the labor force whose supply isshrinkingandcuttaxeson that portion composed of workaholics.Mitt Romney complained about the 47 percent. Paul Ryan’s budget plan includes big tax increases on the middle class. Even Louisiana’sRhode Scholar Governor Bobby Jindal hasdevastatedhis approval ratings for a charge at the windmill of raising sales taxes for the benefit of ‘job creators’ in a state famous for poverty and homicide, and his doomed crusade was not acautionarytale but rather an inspiration to a whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children">Children’s Crusade</a> of suicidal Republican state leaders (<a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2013/04/18/4190126/brownbacks-fight-for-sales-tax.html">evidence</a>).</p>
<p>This agenda makes sense if you’re running a Randian social justice movement to unburden an overworked elite and punish the free-loading masses, but it just has nothing to do with the size of the economic pie, the size of government, utility, or supply side economics. Some Republicans might find itsoberingto contemplate the degree of our degeneracy, but Americans simply do not find the question of whether top rates reach 39.6% or 35% to be the litmus test of the just society. It chills the blood.</p>

<p>What policies could Republicans champion to raise labor force participation? A bunch of nectarines sagging about a foot off the ground:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payroll tax cuts. If the return on middle class labor rises we will see middle class people supply more labor. Ross Douthat (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/opinion/sunday/douthat-our-enemy-the-payroll-tax.html?_r=0">link</a>): “In an era of mass unemployment, mediocre wage growth and weak mobility from the bottom of the income ladder, it makes no sense to finance our retirement system with a tax that falls directly on wages and hiring and imposes particular burdens on small business and the working class.” Last year Republicans did exactly the opposite, using payroll tax extensions as a hostage (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/us/politics/house-republicans-consider-extending-payroll-tax-cut-alone.html">link</a>).</li>
<li>Reorient infrastructure spending toward accessibility and away from geographic equity and awesomeness, under the advertised logic that easier access to jobs will draw marginals into the labor force. Reihan Salam at National Review (<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/345094/when-thinking-about-infrastructure-focus-accessibility-reihan-salam">link</a>): “My sense is that the best way to increase accessibility is to focus on implementing peak road-user fees and using the resulting revenue stream to carefully add capacity at bottlenecks, and also to ease local land use regulations that have proven a barrier to increased density in high-productivity regions.”</li>
<li>Reorient secondary education toward apprenticeships, which means realism about the utility of lofty academics for many, perhaps the majority, of low-income pupils. More shop class will not cut it. Ed Luce in FT (<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/04/apprenticeships-need-more-respect.html">MR link</a>): “Fifteen per cent of taxi drivers in the US have a degree, up from 1 per cent in 1970. Likewise, 25 per cent of sales clerks are graduates, against 5 per cent in 1970. An astonishing 5 per cent of janitors now have a bachelor’s degree…Germany channels roughly half of all high-school students into the vocational education stream from the age of 16….More than 40 per cent of Germans become apprentices. Only 0.3 per cent of the US labour force does so.”</li>
<li>Accelerate the regulatory accommodation of of autonomous vehicles, which will will open up lots of part-time employment to disabled and elderly people.</li>
<li>Reduce occupational licensing. Only hardcore libertarians (<a href="https://www.ij.org/license-to-work-release-5-8-12">Institute for Justice</a>) have so much as mentioned occupation licensing, which is a literal prohibition on working, and none of the legislatures that turned solid red in the last cycle have lifted a finger to solve the problem.In anunder-reportedstory, it was absurd licensing that kicked off the Tunisian Revolution (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_revolution#Sidi_Bouzid_and_Mohamed_Bouazizi">link</a>) and continues to be immolatory problem in that country (<a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/sana-ajmi/young-tunisian-cigarette-vendor-dies-of-self-immolation">link</a>), and Egypt’s unrest is largely due to an economy strangled by a military mafia monopoly (<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_09/b4217012945891.htm">link</a>).</li>
<li>Stricter requirements for disability insurance. (<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/trends-with-benefits">This American Life</a>on the massive expansion of disability cases.)</li>
<li>Reign in the power of local governments to exclude new residents, just as Republicans have reigned in their powers to raise taxes. Many local regulations on building housing are immigration policies under a boring name, and like any immigration policies they keep people from being matched with great jobs. They could say, “Cities are treating working Americans like illegals!”</li>
