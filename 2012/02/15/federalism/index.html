               <h1><a href="/2012/02/15/federalism/">Telescopic Faculties</a></h1>
<p>February 15, 2012</p>
<p>Dr. Lisa Schweitzer replies to the pro-transit bloggers who disdain the house transportation bill (<a href="http://lisaschweitzer.com/2012/02/10/the-house-transport-bill-is-anti-federalist-not-anti-transit/">link</a>):</p>
<p>The bill a does a bunch of really unfortunate things, but the one that has the average urbanist’s undies in a twist is that the bill cuts transit, walking, biking projects off from the Highway Trust Fund, to fend for themselves in the general budgetary process at the federal level.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What House Republicans are disputing in this Bill isn’t whether cities should have adorable little trolley trains and wonderful bikes lanes and capacious sidewalks. What they dispute: that the feds, and not cities themselves, should pay for them.</p>
<p>I want to highlight a political market failure that justifies federal spending on bikes+transit.</p>
<p>Voters exhibit Arthur Pigou&#39;s defective telescopic facultyfor local infrastructure. That is, because infrastructure last longer than each voter is likely to live in a single community, voters will stop investing in infrastructure well before the Net Social Benefits of marginal investment decline to zero.</p>
<p>Let’s say people will enjoy a bike path in Pittsburgh for 50 years. I’m uncertain I will live in Pittsburgh then. But somebody will live in Pittsburgh and receive the benefits of the bike path. Meanwhile, I will probably live somewhere in America and enjoy bike paths wherever that place may be.</p>
<p>We would all be made better off by collectively committing to build infrastructure in our communities. One way to commit is to invest in infrastructure at the federal level.</p>
<p>However, the pork politics and inefficiency wrought by spending other people’s money might outweigh this market failure. For example, Pittsburgh spent half a billion on a rail tunnel to the North Shore, even though we wouldn’t have bought that even if we all had to live in Pittsburgh for the rest of our lives (reverse Groundhog Day). Meanwhile, the bus system underwent massive cuts during the tunnel’s construction phase.</p>
