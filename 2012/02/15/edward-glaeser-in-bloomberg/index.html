               <h1><a href="/2012/02/15/edward-glaeser-in-bloomberg/">A conceptual juggernaut?</a></h1>
<p>February 15, 2012
<a href="http://priceroads.com/2012/02/15/edward-glaeser-in-bloomberg/">Giant_snowball_Oxford</a></p>
<p>From Bloomberg. Dr. Ed Glaeser, author of the excellent Triumph of the City (my review <a href="http://rustwire.com/2011/02/20/the-pros-and-cons-of-triumph-of-the-city/">here</a>), gives ways to improve transportation (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-14/spending-won-t-fix-what-ails-u-s-transport-commentary-by-edward-glaeser.html">link</a>):</p>
<p>IMPLEMENT CONGESTION PRICING: We should expect drivers to pay for more than just the physical costs of their travel. We should also expect them to pay for the congestion that they impose on other road users. If you have a scarce commodity, whether groceries or roads, and you insist on charging prices below market rates, the result will be long lines and stock outs, like those that bedeviled the Soviet Union decades ago. Yet U.S. roads are still running a Soviet-style transport policy, where we charge too little for valuable city streets. Traffic congestion is the urban equivalent of a stock out.</p>
<p>Well said. The common “unpriced roads are Soviet” argument is good marketing for the educated observers who guide policy. It ties congestion pricing to the consensus view, shared even by liberals, that the Soviet Union’s breadlines proved price controls fail outside of medicine.</p>
<p>Is road pricing is nearing escape velocity? That is, is it so nailed into conventional wisdom of wonks and bureaucrats to become a juggernaut…like free trade? Free trade is still unpopular, but among both liberal and conservative leaders it’s litmus test of seriousness and savvy. Consider what Lord Keynes said about Ricardo’s (false) iron laws:</p>
<p>The completeness of the Ricardian victory is something of a curiosity and a mystery. It must have been due to a complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was projected. That it reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect, added, I suppose, to its intellectual prestige. That its teaching, translated into practice, was austere and often unpalatable, lent it virtue. That it was adapted to carry a vast and consistent logical superstructure, gave it beauty. That it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress, and the attempt to change such things as likely on the whole to do more harm than good, commended it to authority.</p>
<p>Luckily, congestion pricing is good policy, unlike Ricardo’s theories. But the same forces–a logical superstructure, progress despite the existence of losers, the futility of most activism–make congestion pricing a perfect idea for what Paul Krugman likes to call the Very Serious People.</p>
