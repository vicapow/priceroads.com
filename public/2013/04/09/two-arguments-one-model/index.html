               <h1><a href="/2013/04/09/two-arguments-one-model/" title="Two arguments, one model?">Two arguments, one model?</a></h1>
<p>April 9, 2013</p>
<p>There are two very simple ways to argue for congestion pricing, and each has its graph. The first is the &quot;marginal vs. average cost argument, which says, &quot;Drivers pay the average cost, not the marginal cost, so too many people enter the network,&quot; or &quot;You suffer the congestion that other  drivers have caused already, but not the congestion that you cause.&quot; The graph makes it clear: there&#39;s a gap between the lines.</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/TE-Pricing-EquilibriumCongestion.png" alt="">
the &quot;marginal cost&quot; argument</p>
<p>This argument is powerful, because it draws on compensatory traditions of justice: clean up after yourself. Your car slows down the many other people in traffic, so you should have to pay something&#8211;if not to them, to the government that supplies their public services or perhaps the roadway itself.</p></p>
<p>However, this model differs from the one transportation economists typically use to model urban congestion: the Vickrey bottleneck model (or one of its elegant elaborations, including the one I have in the pipeline).</p></p>
<p>Summary: Think of an off-ramp to Central Business District. For physical reasons, it can only serve 4,000 vehicles per hour. But for economic reasons, 8,000 vehicles want to be served between 8 and 9 AM. Drivers line up at the ramp to wait their turn, wasting time better spent at home or work. Below a picture from Gonzales and Daganzo (2010).  D(t) is a cumulative count of how many people pass. A(t) counts how many people arrive at the bottleneck. t~ is the time when the most people want to get to work. Ignore W(t)</p>

the Vickrey bottleneck model w/ S-shaped wish curve</p>
<p>In the Vickrey bottleneck, a toll does not serve to speed up traffic. The ramp serves a certain number of people and that&#39;s that. The toll, rather, serves to bring A(t) in line with D(t). More specifically, it serves to (a) prioritize people&#39;s place in line at the queue; (b) relocate the time people spend in line at the ramp to time they spend at home before leaving for work or time they spend at work earlier than work really starts. The (b) effect occurs because, if the toll is structured to keep exactly 4,000 veh/hr arriving at the bottleneck, you can safely stay at home until you&#39;d like to leave for work, confident that there won&#39;t be a big, time-wasting line when you get to the bottleneck.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note the differences in the justice arguments that flow from the two models. In the first, you are slowing everyone down. The first unmoors capacity, while the second fixes it and auctions off who gets it when. The cost you impose in the second one is that you took someone&#39;s place, even though the social benefit of the overall tolling regime is that less time is spent idling.</p>
<p>There seems to be no intuitive tradition of justice in which to ground Vickrey&#39;s argument for a toll at a bottleneck. In fact, there is a strong tradition of &quot;first-come/first-serve,&quot; which prevails because it has never been technological feasible to price slots for anything day-to-day. Therefore, it&#39;s not surprising that planners and people getting masters degrees in public policy will never see the Vickrey model.</p>
<p>Of course, you get a marginal cost/average cost argument out of a Vickrey model,  except that the costs are schedule delay.</p>
