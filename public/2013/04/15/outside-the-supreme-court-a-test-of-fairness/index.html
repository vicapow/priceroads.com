<p>April 15, 2013</p>
<p>The New York Times lofts one to economists everywhere looking for teachable moments. I like that they specifically reference tolls:</p>
<p>Supreme Court Spectator Line Acts as a Toll Booth (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/supreme-court-spectator-line-acts-as-a-toll-booth.html?hp&amp;_r=0">link</a>)</p>
<p>Professor Carpenter’s first surprise on that cold night was that most of the people in front of him in line were not waiting to get in. They were “line standers” who had been paid to hold places for others.</p>
<p>“Many of them seemed to be homeless or very poor,” Professor Carpenter said. “It seemed very shady to me.”</p>
<p>The going rate, he learned, was about $50 an hour, some of which went to a company that had made the arrangements. Such place holding is common at Congressional hearings and is<a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/days-early-a-line-forms-at-the-supreme-court/">on the rise at the Supreme Court</a>, where seats for last month’s arguments<a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/news/2013/03/supreme-court-gay-marriage-tickets-cost-time-money">went for as much as $6,000</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a good way for homeless people to make money and productive people to save time for use on work and family life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/faculty/michael-sandel">Michael J. Sandel</a>, a political philosopher at Harvard, said the phenomenon was disturbing.</p>
<p>“Allowing line-standing companies and scalpers to sell seats in the Supreme Court is yet another instance of letting money dominate democracy,” he said. “It’s at odds with equal access and undermines the dignity of the court.”</p>
<p>I’m not sure how it’s at odds with equal access. My father has severe varicose veins all through his legs and can’t stand up very long without them swelling with blood unto intense soreness. My mother and I, and a large number of Jews, have the opposite problem: severe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raynaud">Raynaud’s Condition</a>. The vessels in our extremities contract under pretty slight cold and leave unbearable stinging. It would be impossible for anyone in my family to hear a Supreme Court argument in the winter except for my robust brother. It would definitely increase access if I could pay my brother to stand in line for me. And if I could pay my brother, could I pay a half-brother? What about a step-brother? What about a good friend? What about a casual acquaintance? What about a stranger?</p>
<p>You’d think the problem could be solved by creating heatedqueuingareas with chairs. But this will increase demand, and there will be lines for the standing areas. You’d think the problem could be solved by creating a lottery system. But people could sell their lottery tickets in a grey market. It is an unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>Everything I have read about Michael J. Sandel suggests he is an eloquent speaker who, like Creationism proponents with PhD’s, ha captured the lucrative market for “qualified people who oppose what is obviously right.” Media relates debate not consensus, so Sandel is quoted constantly. He is apparently garnering a lot of fame and fortune in Asia (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/opinion/friedman-the-professors-big-stage.html">link</a>).</p>
<p>This exactly reinforces <a href="http://priceroads.com/2013/04/09/two-arguments-one-model/" title="Two arguments, one model?">my post</a> about how people accept that travelers should pay for slowing others down but are upset by the prospect of paying for a slot.</p>
