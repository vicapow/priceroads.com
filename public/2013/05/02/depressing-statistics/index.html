               <h1><a href="/2013/05/02/depressing-statistics/" title="depressing statistics">depressing statistics</a></h1>
<p>May 2, 2013</p>
<p>Everyone is debating what the Oregon Health Study means for Medicaid. I am interested in what this study means for medicine. The run down of the study, coauthored by econometrics rock star Amy Finkelstein:</p>
<p>This randomized, controlled study showed that Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first 2 years, but it did increase use of health care services, raise rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and reduce financial strain. (<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1212321">New England Journal of Medicine</a>)</p>
<p>Among the four ‘results’, only one is a change in health: the drop in depression.The prior incidence of depression was 30%, which seems high but isn’t when you consider that Oregon is among the most depressed states (<a href="http://www.nmha.org/go/state-ranking">link</a>), and that poor people are understandably more depressed, and that depression makes it hard to earn money. But anyway, look under the hood:</p>
<p>There was no statistically significant increase in the use of medication for depression, but Medicaid increased the probability of being diagnosed with depression after the lottery</p>
<p>If no medication was dispensed, how did the depression fall? According to this article in the Post (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/18/can-oregon-save-american-health-care/">link</a>), you could get all kinds of counseling and attention:</p>
<p>Doctors had prescribed her 28 medications. Her social anxiety would get so bad that, sometimes, she rubbed her hands raw. By the time Whitaker got to Prineville to live with her cousin, she had given up on the health-care system.</p>
<p>At Mosaic Medical, Whitaker received care for her diabetes and blood pressure. She also began seeing the clinic’s behavioral health specialist every week, who helped tend to her anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Community health workers aided in other ways. They helped to ease her social anxiety by attending bingo night together. When Whitaker expressed an interest in moving out of her cousin’s house, Martinez helped her find an apartment.</p>
<p>“They have been the most moral support I’ve ever had in my life,” Whitaker said. “They cared, and that made me want to care. Little by little, when things got too frustrating in life, I’d see one of them. They changed my whole life.”</p>
<p>More than a judgement on Medicaid, this study is hugely damning for the practice of medicine. The government spent a lot of money giving people health care, and the only thing to show for it was 900 fewer depressed people (9% * 10,000 enrollees). Moreover, 0% of the gains are attributable to medication, and from the passage above appear to have not even been attributable to psychiatrists. This begs the question: at the margin, do we need more health care or more social workers?</p>
<p>The depression results are important, because they are what you might call the ‘residual of the argument.’ Amy Finkelstein said,</p>
<p>“There was this view that Medicaid coverage would not do much for the low-income uninsured, either because they had access to charity care or because Medicaid is not good insurance,” said Amy Finkelstein of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This rejects that notion entirely.”</p>
<p>This is moot. Anyone who was skeptical of Medicaid was skeptical that it improved health. No one was skeptical that Medicaid successfully sent checks to doctors, which is the essence of the claimed benefit of decreased financial hardship.</p>
<p>Consider that flood insurance is subsidized on the basis of helping people hurt by floods. The debate centers on whether this is a worthy expense.No one ever claims that flood insurance reduces flooding.But advocates of health insurance expansion always claim it will make people healthier. So, removing the evidence on things no one was even debating, depression results are the argument’s residual.</p>
<p>People will say that the increased use of medicine will show up later in mortality rates. It’s a long term thing. But none of the short term indicators of long-term distress improved. So either cholesterol and blood sugar and other measurements are not predictive, or the treatments in vogue today don’t change mortality in the long-run. Whether on the testing side or the preventative health side, a lot of money is blowing out the window.</p>
