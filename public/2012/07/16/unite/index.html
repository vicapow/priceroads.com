<p>Brendon Slotterbock at Net Density totally nails an argument I’ve felt for a long time but haven’t been able to put into words. For the unschooled: his critique is directed at a growing, as-yet-unnamed movement of progressive and libertarian pundits who would like to relax zoning in urban areas. The advantages would be higher density and affordable housing.</p>
<p><a href="http://netdensity.net/2012/07/03/2765/">A challenge to the market-oriented urbanists</a></p>
<p>More calls for density based on market forces, fine. But what almost every single one of these articles seems to lack is any robust exploration of how zoning rules are adopted, enforced, and changed and what exactly the author proposes as an alternative.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Zoning laws are made by men and women and enforced by same, often times by existing landowners who are risk- and change-averse. How often has this scene played out across America: 1) Developer buys property 2) Developer decides that in order to make profit, he/she must build something that is larger than zoning allows 3) He/she goes to neighborhood board/zoning board to ask for rezoning or variance 4) Neighbors howl that the building is too tall/will generate too much traffic 5) Zoning board caves or developer backs out 6) Project doesn’t get built or is downsized.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There is no single authority, no dusty bureaucrat simply refusing to pull the magic zoning lever that will unleash the benevolent market forces.</p>
<p>The last sentence is almost a reverse Hayek critique. Hayek claimed that government planning (socialism) would fail, because there were no simple levers to pull. The economy is mostly a “spontaneous order,” the outcome of the decentralized decisions of thousands of individuals who don’t know each other or even understand what their role in a larger process is. Central planners of the 30′s-60′s operated as though there were representative individuals who could be persuaded or coerced.</p>
<p>The irony here is supreme. When Yglesias and Stephen Smith rail against government intervention in local housing, they ignore the actual fermentation of reactionary policy. Bad zoning codes are the outcomes of the decentralized actions of thousands of local preservationists,classists, racists, and general busibodies. My father is an urban planner (focus on environmental planning, e.g. flood plains), and I recall going to community meetings with him when I was young, in which the craziest people in the neighborhood would show up to rant and rave about issues he couldn’t possibly affect. Local policy is inherently messy, because the people who have the most free time have the most voice.</p>
<p>Complaining about bad policy is important, but there should be a next step: designing a viable strategy to overturn them. The greatest piece of political entrepreneurship of our time is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_Top">Race to the Top</a> program, in which Obama made it possible for local education reformers to pit teachers unions against children in a zero-sum grab for federal cash. This was brilliant, cheap, and resulted in a widespread, permanent loss of union power. Taxi deregulation is proceeding mainly via lawsuits on behalf of people with disabilities. Obama Care succeeded in part by guaranteeing doctors and insurers a supply of customers/end to insane pre-existing conditions check work w/o insurance death spiral.</p>
<p>In all these cases, policy entrepreneurs identified a group and advertised a salient benefit to the group. So far, the market urbanists have advertised low-income people as the beneficiaries of relaxed zoning. But low-income people will never understand their arguments, nor are they politically powerful overall. And most importantly, the people who would like to live in the neighborhood are not represented in its politics until they actually do live there.</p>
<p>So here is my proposal: market urbanists should market housing deregulation to public unions. These are the most politically powerful force in every city where over-zoning is significant (San Francisco, New York, DC, Boston). As monopoly providers of local services, public unions benefit from the expansion of their market via population growth. More growth means more work to do and more property taxes for compensation. And since public unions tend to back-load their benefit plans–hitting up future taxpayers–they have a very long-term interest in the population growth of the city. Finally, public unions already have an infrastructure for explaining complicated topics to their members and ensuring people vote correctly.</p>
<p>I think this would be best way since Pabst Blue Ribbon to connect the “young, white collar, Teach-for-America, basketball-watching, Google Reader” segment of the Democratic Party to the “middle-aged, blue collar, hockey-watching, Pixburgh is the greatest country on earth” segment.</p>
