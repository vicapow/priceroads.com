<p>February 27, 2012</p>
<p>Americans for Tax Reform believes that removing the tax credit for ethanol is a tax increase. Therefore, I think if Grover Norquist and ATR say something is nota tax then it’s fair to say it’s not a tax. And <a href="http://www.atr.org/atr-applauds-effort-find-other-methods-a1431#ixzz1nbI3QhdQ">what do you know</a>:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) offered support for H.R. 1767, the Freeing Alternatives for Speedy Transportation (FAST) Act yesterday. The legislation, introduced by Representative Mark Kennedy (R-MN) on April 11, 2003, repeals the outdated prohibition in order to permit expansion on congested interstate corridors paid for by user-fees.</p>
<p>“The plan creates a new revenue stream to fund new roads without increasing the federal gasoline tax,” said Grover Norquist, President of ATR…</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012. The influential group Stolen Lanes opposes HOT lanes projects around Atlanta. On their <a href="http://stolenlanes.org/">website </a>last month, Howard Rodgers claimed <a href="http://stolenlanes.org/2012/01/a-toll-is-a-tax.html">tolls are taxes</a>:</p>
<p>Taxes are used to support government operations, the tolls collected on Georgia roadways are supporting government agencies and operations. Demand your tax credit!</p>
<p>I <a href="http://stolenlanes.org/2012/01/a-toll-is-a-tax.html#comments">commented</a>:</p>
<p>Is a court fee a tax? Is the fee at a municipal parking deck a tax? What about a parking meter? Or the entrance fee to a state park? Or the royalties that oil companies pay to drill on government land? I suppose these are all taxes, since the money from these sources supports government operations.</p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<p>Yes these are actually ALL taxes, the proof is in the ability to use receipts from ALL of the above mentioned ideas by companies and corporations for tax purposes as business expenses. My annual state park pass is deductible, as are my parking fees when used for business expenses. Court fees are also deductible by businesses along with royalties (subsidies). Nice try. The idea that a toll is nothing more than a donation or bribe to use a public road is idiotic. Your linked website would indicate that you either work for the Govt or are a contracted employee of the Govt. and you have a vested interest in the toll (TAX) system.</p>
<p>Obviously Mr. Rodgers’ definition of a tax is more broad than anyone else’s. To be clear, he believes that a park pass is a tax. I wonder if he considers a bus pass to be a tax. In Mr. Rodgers’ neighborhood virtually all money that enters the account of a government agency is a form of taxation. I would assume that your electricity bill is a form of taxation if your power provider is publicly-owned, too.</p>
<p>Advocates of road pricing should do more to engage opponents philosophically. The logical extensions of anti-pricing arguments are easy to reach and obviously counter to American traditions of government. Road pricing is a tax because it pays for government? Then park passes are taxes. Road pricing is unfair because it lets rich people buy more of something? Then gasoline, bus and corn pricing is unfair.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I don’t work for the government. I’m a graduate student in England. However, I do have a vested interest in the “toll (TAX)” system, since I plan to work one day and would pay money to bypass traffic.</p>
