<p>June 13, 2012
<a href="http://priceroads.com/2012/06/13/taking-a-chance-on-lotteries/">PALotteryLogo</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/science/experimental-campaigns-pay-drivers-to-avoid-rush-hour-traffic.html?_r=4&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=science#comments">Incentives for Drivers Who Avoid Traffic Jams</a></p>
<p>London, Singapore, Stockholm and a few other cities around the world battle heavy traffic with a “congestion charge,” a stiff fee for driving in crowded areas at peak hours. But drivers generally hate the idea, and efforts to impose it in this country have failed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~balaji/" title="Web site">Balaji Prabhakar</a>, a professor of computer science at<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/stanford_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, thinks he has a better way.</p>
<p>So this spring, with a $3 million research grant from the federal Department of Transportation, Stanford deployed a new system designed by Dr. Prabhakar’s group. Called Capri, for<a href="https://stanfordcapri.org/welcomeinfo.php" title="Web site">Congestion and Parking Relief Incentives</a>, it allows people driving to the notoriously traffic-clogged campus to enter a daily lottery, with a chance to win up to an extra $50 in their paycheck, just by shifting their commute to off-peak times.</p>
<p>The article reports that the experiment is a success. I wish the best for lottery initiatives. However, I’m wary for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a lottery reliably cuts the peak-hour traffic enough to improve congestion, then after a while we will see some induced demand at the peak. The lottery will move some of the former peak-hourtravellersto an earlier time, but the reduced congestion will shift sometravellersinto the peak.</li>
<li>The human mind is quick to categorize. In this case we have put “lottery payments” and “pricing” into a box labelled “congestion strategies.” We are prone to think they are competing with one another because they are both solutions to the same problem. In fact this intuition is entirely wrong. The policies are on opposite sides of the government’s balance sheet. Some of the critics in the NYTimes article say “That’s nice, but how do you pay for it?” That’s not the issue. The issue is that you can have as big a lottery system as you want without forgoing any ability to price the roads. It’s weird, because most solutions really do compete with one another. Spending on buses reduces a cities’ possible road upgrades. But there’s simply no trade-off here.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am hopeful about this program for one reason:</p>
<ol>
<li>This would might be very effective for senior citizens. They can alter their schedules more easily, and they love games of chance. Elderly people love bingo, lotteries and slot machines.</li>
</ol>
